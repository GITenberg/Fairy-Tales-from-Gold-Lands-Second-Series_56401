<p>In the pleasant Christmas-time I greet the
children everywhere.</p>

<p>To some I shall not be a stranger, for we have
met before, not face to face, but in the pages of
the last year&#8217;s little book. In the sunny days of
childhood, a year is so long a time, that when the
summer and winter have passed it seems like an
age gone by; yet as again I bring my Christmas
offering, I hope to be remembered and welcomed
as the friend who loves the children well.</p>

<p>They are the true critics, generous and fearless.
For their warm hearts and keen appreciation, I
write these stories of the Golden Clime.</p>

<p>May the joy and blessedness of the holy Christmas
rest upon them, and follow them through all
the sunshine and rain of the coming year.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE LITTLE LACE-MAKER.</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was the happy Christmas Eve, yet it
was very cold and dark. Over the quaint
old town of Bruges hung the heavy snow-clouds,
and the air was filled with snow-flakes,
which fell so thick and fast that
very soon the ground was covered with a
white mantle, quickly hiding the foot-prints
of the few who were still out buying the
last gifts for beautiful Christmas trees.
Through the narrow streets rushed the
wind, shrieking round the comers in its
shrill whistle, and seeming to say:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<div class="indent3">&#8220;As I go,</div>
<div class="indent3">I bring the snow,</div>
<div class="verse">On this holy Christmas Eve.</div>
<div class="indent3">Who can show</div>
<div class="indent3">Hearts like snow,</div>
<div class="verse">On this holy Christmas Eve?</div>
<div class="indent3">Blow, blow, blow!</div>
<div class="indent3">Pure and fleecy snow,</div>
<div class="verse">On this holy Christmas Eve.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>It was really strange what curious things
the wind whistled that night, yet through
all ran the refrain of the holy Christmas
Eve.</p>

<p>Near the great belfry of Bruges was a
stately mansion, where the fires burned
brightly in the polished grates with a
warm, rosy glow, making upon the wall
grotesque shadows of a little boy and girl
who were joyous with expectant happiness.</p>

<p>It was early, and the lamps were not
yet lighted. The children danced up and
down the warm, pleasant room, where they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
were to remain until the mother called
them.</p>

<p>The dear, loving mother had been so
busy in the great parlor, doing something
full of mystery, yet the children were quite
sure it was a delightful mystery, that would
bring them a great store of happiness, and
they were luxuriating in their own pleasant
imaginings. The door was still locked, but
the time was fast approaching for the grand
opening.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t wait! I can&#8217;t wait much longer,&#8221;
said the boy, impatiently. &#8220;What a lazy
old thing Santa Claus is!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For shame, brother, to speak so of the
good Santa Claus, who brings us such
beautiful gifts. I will watch for him, the
kind old Santa Claus, to come from the
gift land for us in all the wind and snow,&#8221;
and the little girl ran to the window and
drew aside the rich, heavy curtain.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>&#8220;But Santa Claus always comes down
the chimney, little Miss Wisdom,&#8221; said the
boy, joining her. &#8220;How it snows! I&#8217;m so
glad. &#8217;Twill be such fun for us boys to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis the old woman up in the clouds,
picking her goose for Christmas dinner,&#8221;
said the little girl, laughing and singing,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<div class="verse">&#8220;Old woman, up in the clouds so high,</div>
<div class="verse">Making the feathers about us fly,</div>
<div class="verse">Picking your geese for Christmas pie,</div>
<div class="verse">Give me a piece of it by and by!&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>Just then the mother was heard calling,
and the children ran into the great parlor,
all ablaze with light and beauty. In the
center of all rose the beautiful Christmas
tree, luminous with shining toys and many-hued
candles.</p>

<p>Oh, it was delightful! To the little ones
nothing could compare with the long-dreamed-of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
Christmas tree full of beautiful
presents, just what they had been wanting,
and hoped that wonderful old diviner,
Santa Claus, would think of; and, of the
whole year to them, no time was like the
glorious Christmas season.</p>

<p>In quite another part of the town, very
poor and squalid, lived the lace weavers.</p>

<p>In quaint old buildings, falling to ruins,
they were huddled together, many wretched
homes under one roof, yet even there
they were trying to celebrate the birth of
the blessed Christ child.</p>

<p>In the dingy rooms burned cheap tallow
candles, and the little ones, with their poor
wee gifts, were as happy as the brother
and sister with the beautiful Christmas
tree in the stately mansion.</p>

<p>One room only, a very small one, up in
an attic in the lace-weavers&#8217; quarters, was
in darkness. By the window stood a little,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
sorrowful girl, very pale-faced, all alone,
watching the snow-flakes.</p>

<p>It was very cold, and her clothes were
thin and ragged. She shivered, for she
was quite chilled through. She was an
orphan. The father had died, oh! long
ago, one whole year, an age in the life of a
child. Only the week before, the mother
was driven away to her last home in the
paupers&#8217; grave-yard, to rest in the plain
deal coffin, till beautiful white wings should
waft her up to Heaven the Golden.</p>

<p>It was very sad to see the little pale-faced
child looking after the paupers&#8217; cart,
driven so roughly over the frozen ground,
and the kind-hearted neighbors had pitied
her, and, though they were poor lace-makers
like the mother, they had given her food
with their sympathy, and promised to help
her on with the trade.</p>

<p>They were true-hearted, honest folk, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
somehow in this joyous Christmas season
they had all forgotten her, and, far up in
the dreary attic-chamber of the old tenement-house,
she looked out into the night
and storm alone.</p>

<p>It was so dark in the room that she
could not bear to leave the window, though
the wind whistled in at the loose casement,
making quite a clatter, and causing her
little teeth to chatter with cold.</p>

<p>She was very hungry. She had eaten
the last crust the night before, and everybody
had been so busy. It was not strange,
she thought, that they had forgotten her.</p>

<p>She could remember the last Christmas
they were all together. How busy the
mother was making the Christmas pie,
and how the father brought home a wooden
doll, saying, &#8220;&#8217;Tis for my good little
daughter,&#8221; and kissed her. Then, taking
her on his shoulder, he danced all about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
the room, and how the dear mother
laughed.</p>

<p>She was so happy then, and now so
desolate and wretched. Everybody else
was happy; she heard the children shouting,
and she was so faint and hungry.</p>

<p>Just then a man, in an oil-cloth coat and
cap, came along, and lighted the street lamp
opposite the window. That made it more
cheerful; still, the child was so cold and
hungry, she could bear it no longer.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will go out,&#8221; she thought, &#8220;into the
light. Perhaps I shall dare to go in somewhere.
The neighbors have been so kind
to me, but I&#8217;m not used to them as I was
to the dear mother. I will wish them a
&#8216;Merry Christmas,&#8217; and they will give me
something to eat. Then, perhaps, I can
sleep, and go away in my dreams to the
beautiful land where it is warm with God&#8217;s
pleasant sunshine.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>Taking from the shelf a faded shawl and
torn bonnet, which had been the mother&#8217;s,
she fastened them on as well as she could.
But they were too large; it was all of no
use, they would slip off again.</p>

<p>As she opened the door of her chamber,
a great draught of wind rushed in from
the street. Some one was coming in at the
common staircase. She heard merry voices
and footsteps on the stairs. She drew
back into the darkness of her own room
with shrinking timidity.</p>

<p>Very strange it was to her the cheery
laughing, yet she had been as light-hearted
once, but it seemed a great while
ago.</p>

<p>When the sound of voices died away,
she stole softly down the stairs to the door
of the great front room, which had always
been the grand place to her. Of all the
neighbors, the woman in this best room<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
had been most kind to her and the poor
mother in <i>her</i> sickness.</p>

<p>The little cold fingers gave a timid
knock, but, within, the father and mother
were talking, and the little ones laughing
so loud, that no one said the welcome
&#8220;Come in,&#8221; or came to open the door.</p>

<p>The cold winds whistled through the
uncovered halls of the tenement house,
and the child stood waiting with chattering
teeth, and feet and hands so benumbed
that she thought it would be better out in
the street. There she could run and warm
herself.</p>

<p>It was snowing fast, and the feathery
flakes fell all over the worn shawl, covering
its faded colors with soft white down;
over the great bonnet that would fall back
upon her neck; and over the rich, golden-brown
curls, that were left bare to the
storm.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>As she ran on, the streets grew lighter,
and on each side of the way were gay
shops, with great windows filled with a
thousand beautiful things. How much better
it was than staying in the dark attic-room
alone; and she thought, if she were
not so cold and hungry, she could have
quite enjoyed it.</p>

<p>There was a great jolly man walking on
before her, humming a song. Presently he
stopped to look in at a shop window, and
she read in his broad, pleasant face that his
heart was kind and loving. So, without
stopping to dread it, she ran up to him,
saying, &#8220;Please, sir, I wish you a merry
Christmas.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, ha! little one,&#8221; he said kindly,
&#8220;you&#8217;ve caught a Christmas gift, but it is
too stormy a night for little things like
you to be out.&#8221; Drawing from his pocket
one of many small packages, he said, &#8220;My<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
babies will never miss this. Now run
home, like a good child; no doubt the
mother is calling you now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he hurried on, and the child, with
trembling fingers, untied the parcel. How
she hoped it was a piece of bread; but
no! It was a pretty toy lamb, with a fleece
as white as the snow that was covering
her.</p>

<p>She was so much disappointed that the
tears ran down her face very fast, and in
the storm and cold this was uncomfortable.</p>

<p>Just then the beautiful chimes sounded
from the great belfry of Bruges. This
Christmas Eve they were played by a
famous musician, who sat in the chamber
below the belfry, and struck upon an immense
key-board like that of a piano.
These keys connect with hammers that
strike the bells, so that in all the world<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
there are no chimes like those of the belfry
of Bruges.</p>

<p>There the grand musician sat and played,
throwing the whole harmony of his soul
into the music, and all the town of Bruges
stopped to listen, and, clasping each other&#8217;s
hands, whispered softly, &#8220;How beautiful!&#8221;
for the divine music thrilled them.</p>

<p>Above all, it went to the heart of the
little hungry child, out alone in the pitiless
night and storm. The voices of the matchless
chimes led her, and she hurried on to
the great belfry, clasping the pretty white
lamb closely in her little chilled hand.</p>

<p>Somehow she did not feel so hungry
now, and that was a blessing. There was
the stately mansion all ablaze with light.
She could look in through the rich crimson
curtains of the grand parlor window,
and see the beautiful Christmas tree, and
the happy children dancing around it.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>It was very near the belfry, and she sat
down on the broad steps, and, wrapping
her shawl about her, listened to the wonderful
chimes.</p>

<p>Still the snow fell heavily, covering her
over with its cold white mantle, but she
did not move. The voice of the chimes
was whispering in her ear such beautiful
things. It was delightful, and all the
dread shadows that filled the night and
storm faded away, for they were only born
of earth.</p>

<p>Yes! it told her of a great Christmas
tree up in Heaven the Golden. There was
a pure white robe and shining wings, the
priceless gift of the Father&#8217;s love. These
were all marked with her name, and she
was very happy.</p>

<p>She was no longer hungry nor cold, for
the snow mantle was thick now over her
little shrunken form. Only the tiny pale<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
face looked out from the white covering,
and that was leaning against the pillar
of the great doorway. The old bonnet
had fallen off; and she tried no longer
to confine it. When the storm was over
and the moon came out, it shone upon her
golden brown hair, making it luminous
with beauty.</p>

<p>How smoothly it sailed along, that crescent
boat of the sky; and the deep blue
eyes watching it saw such marvelous sights
so pleasant, that a sweet peace gathered
around the child. The poor little heart,
that in the early hours of the blessed
Christmas Eve beat with the quick flutter
of fearful timidity and loneliness, was at
rest in the holy calm.</p>

<p>Yes! there was the dear mother in the
Golden Boat, so peaceful and free from
care. How tenderly her dear eyes shone,
and how beautiful she was in the radiant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
light of heaven! She beckoned with her
hand, and the little child reached eagerly
out to her, crying, &#8220;It is the mother! Oh,
mother, dear, I am coming! Wait, mother!
I am com&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Up to the Crescent Boat on to Heaven
the Golden, and to the throne of the loving
God, had passed the spirit of the little
child. Just then a bright star fell down
from the fleecy clouds and rested upon the
pure, ice-cold forehead, leaning so heavily
against the great pillar of the stately
doorway.</p>

<p>The cadence of the last chime was dying
away upon the still night air. It was
twelve o&#8217;clock, and the musician went
home. The great belfry was left silent, and
in the coming of the holy Christmas dawning
all the peaceful town of Bruges slept.</p>

<p>In the morning the servant found a little
child dead upon the door steps of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
grand mansion, with the frost glittering
like a crown of glory in her golden hair.
It was said she was a poor lace-maker&#8217;s
child, who had died in great poverty and
want. The crowd gathered about the door,
saying, &#8220;It is sad, oh! very sad!&#8221; but they
knew nothing of what the music of the
bells had been to her&mdash;nothing of the
Golden Boat.</p>

<p>At last, when men came to take the
poor little thing away to the paupers&#8217;
burying-ground, the good mother of the
house said, &#8220;No, do not take her away,
I entreat you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then she folded the child in her arms,
kissing her pale cheeks and golden hair,
saying, &#8220;I will see to it. The good Lord
led her to my door, and, though it is late,
I will do all there is left me. She shall
rest in the pleasant garden under the linden-trees.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>Dear little one! We can do nothing
more now, but in Heaven the Golden the
loving God will receive her, a most precious
Christmas offering!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">GOLDEN SNOW.</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> snow-flakes were falling all over
the northern Gold Land, for it was mid-winter.
Against the ice-bound shore the
angry breakers of the great Pacific dashed,
and the wind whistled like a trumpeter.</p>

<p>A warm fire burned on the hearth of
the fisherman&#8217;s hut, and with a red face
the good-wife bent over it, preparing the
supper. The old man stood by the window
looking out, and thinking his poor
thoughts of the wind and the tide, which
ended always with the same refrain, &#8220;God
help us fisher folk!&#8221; Suddenly he gave
a quick start, exclaiming&mdash;&#8220;Hark! wife;
what is that?&#8221;</p>

<p>The old woman dropped the wooden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
spoon, and listened to the clear voices that
rose above the storm:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">&#8220;Golden Snow! Golden Snow!</div>
<div class="indent3">To and fro;</div>
<div class="verse">Over her little heart</div>
<div class="indent3">We blow,</div>
<div class="verse">Our dear little sister,</div>
<div class="indent3">Golden Snow.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">&#8220;Open your door,</div>
<div class="indent3">That the fire-light&#8217;s glow</div>
<div class="verse">May tinge the cheek</div>
<div class="indent3">Of Golden Snow&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Oh! dear little sister,</div>
<div class="indent3">Golden Snow.&#8221;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Then came the savage old trumpeter,
and blew a great blast close by the door
and window of the little hut. It was
really quite startling, and the old woman
clung to her husband&#8217;s arm; but above
all they could hear the shrill clear voices
calling&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;Open the door,</div>
<div class="indent3">For the wild winds blow</div>
<div class="verse">Over the heart</div>
<div class="indent3">Of Golden Snow.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>&#8220;I can not do it,&#8221; said the good-wife,
trembling; but the old man walked straight
to the door. Though his wife entreated
him, saying, &#8220;It is the Evil One who calls
without, dear husband, do not open it,&#8221; he
lifted the latch fearlessly. With a great
bang in rushed the wind and blew out the
candle.</p>

<p>&#8220;God save us!&#8221; cried the good-wife,
crossing herself, almost ready to swoon
with fright.</p>

<p>A bright glow from the fire fell upon a
willow basket, covered with a fine crimson
cloth. As the old man took it up, a little
wailing cry rose, which touched the woman&#8217;s
heart more than all her fears. Taking
it from her husband, she exclaimed&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;God pity it! It is a little innocent
child!&#8221;</p>

<p>The old man pressed hard upon the
door, and drove out the ugly wind. Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
he came to the fire, and saw his wife folding
in her kind arms the most beautiful
little child that even a poet could imagine.
She was as white as a snow-flake, only the
rose tinge upon her cheeks and her lips
were like ripe cherries. Her hair was soft
as silk, and lay in pretty waves of gold
about her head, like the shining crown of
a little princess.</p>

<p>The good people were greatly bewildered;
but when they looked into the
liquid blue eyes of the little one, it seemed
like a deep fountain of happiness that was
opened to them, and they were delighted
beyond measure. As they had no children,
this child seemed like a God&#8217;s gift, and
they adopted her for their own.</p>

<p>Her little robes were of the finest material,
daintily embroidered, but among them
all there was nothing to tell her name or
parentage, only a coral necklace with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
golden clasp, engraved with the letters
&#8220;G. S.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Was ever any thing so strange?&#8221; said
the good-wife. &#8220;But she is our child now,
and we will call her Golden Snow, for her
hair is shining like gold, and her complexion
fair as the driven snow.&#8221;</p>

<p>The poor fisher-folk had now something
to love, and were never so happy in their
lives.</p>

<p>The long winter gave place to the pleasant
summer time, and the little child grew
lovelier day by day, till in all the northern
gold land there was not a maiden who
could compare with her.</p>

<p>Good fortune had followed the fisherman.
Ever since that stormy night he
had never drawn in his net empty, and
there had been always plenty in the larder.
The old woman often said, &#8220;It all comes
of Golden Snow&mdash;she is our luck child.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>As the years went by, she had taught
the maiden all she knew herself, which was
little enough, to be sure; but the child
had other teachers. From the birds she
received the gift of song, and learned the
wonderful stories of the far southern lands.</p>

<p>The leaves of summer, and the evergreens
of winter, whispered a thousand
pleasant things in her ear, but it was the
snow-flakes that she loved best of all. The
old fisher-folk often heard them calling her
as they flew about in the winter storm:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;Golden Snow! Golden Snow!</div>
<div class="indent3">You are one of us.</div>
<div class="verse">When the wild winds blow,</div>
<div class="indent3">Come out to us</div>
<div class="verse">From the fire-light&#8217;s glow.</div>
<div class="indent3">You are our sister,</div>
<div class="verse">Golden Snow.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>Then, before the good-wife could stop
her, the little maiden would fly out into
the storm, full of joy, dancing about as
lightly as the snow-flakes themselves.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>At first the old fisherman would run
after her, and bring her in quickly, for
fear that the chill of the storm would kill
her; but when he saw that this only saddened
her, and how rosy, laughing, and
healthful she always was with the snow-flakes,
he said to the good-wife&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;They do not harm her&mdash;let the child
have her way.&#8221;</p>

<p>After this they would stand by the window
watching her; and very often they
heard her saying&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;My pretty sisters, how merry we are&mdash;how
much I love you! The winter, oh!
the winter, is the joy time, and my sisters
the fairies of the winter.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the snow-flakes would answer:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="indent3">&#8220;Golden Snow,</div>
<div class="verse">Many maids are fair,</div>
<div class="indent3">We know,</div>
<div class="verse">But none like the princess</div>
<div class="indent3">Golden Snow.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>So it happened that the old fisher-folk
found out that Golden Snow was a princess,
and they no longer wondered at the
innate grace of the lovely child. Every
thing she said, and all her ways, was so
charming that it was impossible to resist
her; but as she was so gentle and good,
this was all well. Every night, before she
went to sleep, she said reverently&mdash;&#8220;Our
Father, who art in heaven.&#8221; The loving
God heard her, and kept her heart pure,
as she passed on through the portals of
childhood into timid, dreamy maidenhood.</p>

<p>One day, in the winter time, when Golden
Snow was about fifteen years old, a herald
rode by the fisherman&#8217;s cottage, crying&mdash;&#8220;The
prince! the prince will marry the
most beautiful maiden in all the Gold
Land. Hear! hear! the prince will marry
the most-beautiful maiden in all the Gold
Land!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>Then the old fisherman went out and
asked the messenger what it meant.</p>

<p>&#8220;It means this,&#8221; replied the man, &#8220;that
though the prince and all his ancestors
were born in Russia, he has determined to
marry only in the Gold Land, and the most
beautiful maiden. For you must know,
that though he is so high born in the old
world, the estates are getting poor, but
here he has won every thing. He has
opened a mine so rich that he will never
be able to count his money. He wishes
his children to be real lords of the Gold
Land&mdash;to be miner princes. So here he
will marry even the poorest maiden, but
she must be the most beautiful.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he told how all the lovely young
girls in the country were invited to a great
feast at the castle, and that the prince
would choose a wife from among them.</p>

<p>After this, the herald went crying before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
every house, no matter how humble, for
this was the command of the prince.</p>

<p>The old fisherman went into the cottage,
and told all to the good-wife.</p>

<p>&#8220;Golden Snow is the most beautiful
maiden,&#8221; she answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the old man, &#8220;Golden Snow
is the most beautiful, but he who wins
must seek her. She should not go to the
castle for a husband, even though he were
a king.&#8221;</p>

<p>This grieved the mother, for all her life
she had eaten the bread of toil, and she
longed to see the dainty fingers of her
adopted child covered with rings, and to
have her wear costly trailing robes, such
as the wives and daughters of the great
miner princes wore.</p>

<p>In the corner sat Golden Snow, braiding
her silken hair, which was so long it
swept the ground. She bound the broad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
plaits about her head, and formed a shiny-crown.</p>

<p>&#8220;Was there ever any thing like it?&#8221; said
the old woman, sighing, and passing her
brown hand fondly over the beautiful
tresses.</p>

<p>&#8220;The father is right,&#8221; replied Golden
Snow. &#8220;My sisters will see to it. Have
never a care, mother;&#8221; and the maiden
began singing the nightingale&#8217;s song, till
the rafters of the old hut rang with the
silvery melody.</p>

<p>&#8220;The chit of a child has never a care,&#8221;
thought the old woman, &#8220;but it is different
with me, who know what life is.&#8221;</p>

<p>All through the north land there was
great excitement. Everywhere the young
girls wrought upon gay dresses, and the
fathers and mothers consulted together,
that nothing might be wanting in the ball
costumes of their daughters, for each one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
thought&mdash;&#8220;Our child is the most beautiful
maiden.&#8221;</p>

<p>The morning dawned without a ray of
sunshine. Only the heavy snow-clouds
covered the sky.</p>

<p>&#8220;My sisters are getting ready for the
ball to-night,&#8221; laughed Golden Snow.
&#8220;Very soon the messengers will be flying
out after the fleecy fringes and ribbons, for
every one must be dressed in the real court
costume.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Silly child, silly child,&#8221; answered the
old woman; yet silently she thought&mdash;&#8220;If
my daughter could go to the ball, the prince
would surely fall in love with her, for in
all the north land she is the only true
princess.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;See, they are coming, mother!&#8221; exclaimed
Golden Snow, clapping her hands
with delight.</p>

<p>The old woman looked out of the window,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
and saw everywhere the snow-flakes
flying about, like little madcaps, over hill
and valley.</p>

<p>It seemed a long day to her; there was
a chill in the air, and she was not happy.
Satos, the old fisherman, came in, saying,
in his good-natured voice, &#8220;It will be
stormy to-night, wife.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, well,&#8221; replied she, &#8220;what will that
matter to us, who stay at home?&#8221;</p>

<p>Just then a knock came at the door;
and when the old man opened it, he saw a
stately lady, who was so covered with
snow that no part of her dress could be
seen. It was like a cloak about her. Upon
her head she wore a band of shining brilliants,
that so dazzled the old man that he
could not speak a word.</p>

<p>The lady stepped into the cottage, and
when she saw Golden Snow, she embraced
her fondly, saying, &#8220;My dear child, I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
not forgotten that it is your birthday, and
that you are now fifteen years old.&#8221; She
took a little box from her pocket, and
placed it upon the floor. In a few moments
it had increased to so great a size that it
was large enough to hold the entire wardrobe
of a lady.</p>

<p>Golden Snow kissed her hand, and
thanked her again and again.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must go now,&#8221; said the lady; &#8220;I can
not endure the heat; but never fear, my
child, for your sisters shall attend to every
thing. Now, good-bye;&#8221; and again she
embraced the young maiden tenderly, and
in a moment was gone.</p>

<p>The fisherman and his wife had been
standing gazing upon this scene in silent
amazement; but when the lady had disappeared,
and they could not see how, the
old woman recovered her voice&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Father,&#8221; she exclaimed, &#8220;the lady! she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
did not go out at the door, nor the window;
how did she go?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t ask me, wife&mdash;I don&#8217;t know any
thing,&#8221; replied the old man in a bewildered
way. &#8220;I believe&mdash;I rather think I am in
the fog.&#8221; And after this he sank into a
chair, and did not speak again for an hour.
He was trying in vain to get out of the
fog. A clear, ringing laugh startled the
old man; it was Golden Snow, whose eyes
were glistening with mirth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who was she, child?&#8221; asked the good-wife.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was the Snow Queen, mother,&#8221; replied
the young girl, as soon as she could
speak for laughing. &#8220;But now let us look
at my birthday gift.&#8221;</p>

<p>The good woman&#8217;s curiosity overcame
her wonder; so, taking the silver key, she
unlocked the great box, and displayed
such a quantity of beautiful things, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
her admiration was as great as her amazement.</p>

<p>There were shining robes of silver and
gold cloth, and rich cloaks of fur, ornamented
with glittering gems. Golden Snow
was almost wild with delight, and her
beaming eyes glistened with the unexpected
pleasure. And the good-wife, though
the mysticism troubled her greatly, could
not but rejoice at the sight of all these
treasures.</p>

<p>She took up a robe of silver cloth, richly
embroidered with gold, saying, &#8220;Oh! my
child, if you could only wear this to the
ball, I should live to see you the bride of a
real prince, and the richest man in all the
Russian possessions, except the great czar
himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old woman sighed heavily, adding,
&#8220;It would not be right to say aught against
the good-man, for there is nobody like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
him; but I do believe he would have his
way if old Nickey Bend stood at the door
with his cloven hoof, so it is no use talking&mdash;we
must give up the ball, my child.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I am content,&#8221; said Golden Snow,
fastening a string of pearls into the shining
crown that she had formed of her own
abundant tresses. Then she threw about
her a rich fur mantle, made of a thousand
different skins of the finest quality.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must go now, and dance for a while
with my sisters. Remember, mother,&#8221; she
added, as the old woman shook her head,
&#8220;it is my birthnight&mdash;you would not deny
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old woman listened, and heard the
clear voices calling:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;&#8217;Tis thy birthnight, sister fair,</div>
<div class="verse">Join us fairies of the air.</div>
<div class="verse">Where the night-winds round us blow</div>
<div class="verse">We are waiting, Golden Snow.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>&#8220;Kiss me, mother, for I must go,&#8221; said
the maiden, eagerly. And with the old
woman&#8217;s kiss warm upon her cheek, she
ran out and danced with the pretty snow-flakes
till her face glowed and her eyes
sparkled like the rich carbuncle that clasped
her mantle.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is getting late; come in, child! come
in!&#8221; called the old woman, who grew
weary waiting.</p>

<p>The maiden kissed her white hands to
the fleecy snow-flakes, singing like a bird&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;Good night!</div>
<div class="verse">Snow-flakes white.</div>
<div class="verse">Golden Snow</div>
<div class="verse">Now must go.</div>
<div class="verse">Sisters white,</div>
<div class="verse">Good night! Good night!&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>There was a little sound, as though soft
hands met and young lips kissed each
other, and Golden Snow ran into the
house, rosy, joyous, and ready to obey the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
good mother, even when she said, &#8220;Go to
bed, my dear child,&#8221; though the bright
eyes were still wide awake.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will tell me a story, mother,&#8221; said
the young girl, in a coaxing tone.</p>

<p>So the old woman sat down by the bedside,
and told her a wonderful story of the
olden time, how a fair princess was changed
into a blue bird by the incantations of a
wicked old witch, who had red eyes, and
had studied the black art. And how, after
a long time, the cruel enchantment was
broken by a brave young prince, who had
marvelous adventures. &#8220;So it all ended
happily,&#8221; said the old mother, bending over
Golden Snow to kiss her. Then she saw
that the young maiden slept, and she stood
gazing upon her fresh young face, and
thinking curious thoughts, which somehow
were enwoven with the web of the story
she had been telling, but all ended in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
this:&mdash;&#8220;Golden Snow is the most beautiful
maiden.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At the castle the musicians were playing,
and the grand saloon was like an
enchanted hall, with fragrant air and gorgeous
light. The delicious music stole into
the heart, and throbbed in the impassioned
pulses of the guests, the noble gentlemen
and fair ladies.</p>

<p>The dark-eyed brunette rivaled the delicate
blonde, and all were lovely in their
dainty robes, with the soft mellow light
floating around them.</p>

<p>Amid the festive throng, with courtly
hospitality, walked the young prince. The
winds and sun had bronzed his handsome
face, and the damp exhalations of the mine
had moistened the rich curls of his dark
hair. Yet nothing in all the rough miner&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
life had harmed him in any way. He was
a prince born, and a real prince at heart.
There was not a father in the north land
who would not have taken him by the
hand, nor a mother who would not have
been proud of him. Even the young maidens
whispered together, &#8220;He is a <i>man</i>;
one could look up to him, and that is the
best of all.&#8221;</p>

<p>The prince was attentive to all his fair
guests, but he danced more with the consul&#8217;s
daughter. She was a proud young
beauty, so ambitious, that she had treated
with scorn many an honest heart in the
Gold Land.</p>

<p>&#8220;My great-great-grandfather was younger
brother to an earl, and I am beautiful
enough to be the bride of a nobleman,&#8221;
she would say, as she sat by her
mirror. When the herald came with
the invitation to the ball, she determined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
in her mind to marry the rich Russian
prince.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; she thought, &#8220;I am the
most beautiful, so that is settled. I will
go back to the old world, where I will
astonish even the queen with the richness
of my dress and the luster of my jewels,
and every one will pay court to the princess
of the Gold Land.&#8221;</p>

<p>So she went to the ball with glistening
eyes and a proud flush upon her cheek,
and all the guests whispered, &#8220;The consul&#8217;s
daughter is the most beautiful maiden.&#8221;
It found an echo in the heart of the
prince, so that the matter seemed really
decided.</p>

<p>Just then the music ceased, for the musicians
were weary. The dancers were
quite out of breath, and the windows of
the grand saloon were opened to admit
the refreshing air.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>Without, the snow-flakes were holding
their revel in honor of the princess Golden
Snow. Up to the great carved windows
they flew, and their clear voices sounded
through the ball-room so distinctly, that
the prince and all his guests heard them:</p>

<div class="verse">&#8220;The consul&#8217;s daughter is fair, we know,</div>
<div class="verse">But not like the beautiful Golden Snow.</div>
<div class="verse">There are lovely maids at the castle ball,</div>
<div class="verse">But Golden Snow is fairer than all.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>The flush of pride in the cheek of the
consul&#8217;s daughter gave place to the deeper
red of anger. Her eyes shot flames of fire,
and her brow darkened with heavy clouds.
&#8220;What does this insult mean?&#8221; she said
sharply to the prince.</p>

<p>The young man gave a start, as though
he were awaking from a dream. &#8220;It is
strange,&#8221; he answered, &#8220;but it shall be
looked to, lady. What it means I can not
tell.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>He called his servants, telling them to
bring in the people who were crying without.
When the men returned, they were
trembling, and seemed quite afraid.</p>

<p>&#8220;There are a hundred voices, but no
person is without, only the snow-flakes
flying about like living things.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the prince went out himself, and a
great search was made all over the grounds
of the castle, but not a human being could
be found. Still, everywhere the voices
could be heard, and the snow-flakes thickened,
till at last the search was given up.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is the work of magic and evil,&#8221; said
the consul and all his friends; but the
prince offered a great reward to any one
who would find the beautiful Golden Snow,
and all the guests were invited to return
in one week&#8217;s time.</p>

<p>All the week the young prince could
think of nothing but the mysterious voices<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
that pursued him, and everywhere his
messengers were seeking for the beautiful
Golden Snow.</p>

<p>The consul&#8217;s daughter was nearly wild
with rage and disappointment. One evening,
in the dusky twilight, she went down
into the shadows of a dark cañon, and consulted
a wicked old witch, who lived in a
dismal cavern.</p>

<p>&#8220;Am I not the fairest of all the
maidens in the new world?&#8221; she asked,
&#8220;but what means this cry of &#8216;Golden
Snow?&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are very fair,&#8221; answered the old
witch, &#8220;but I must read the stars.&#8221; So
she went down into the lowest depths of
the cañon, and in the bottom of a deep
well she read the stars:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;There were maidens fair at the prince&#8217;s ball,</div>
<div class="verse">But Golden Snow is fairer than all.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>&#8220;What does it mean?&#8221; asked the consul&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
daughter, pale and trembling with
emotion.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will tell you! Golden Snow is the
Elixir of Beauty, and if you can obtain it,
and wash in it, you will become the most
enchanting maiden in the world.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where shall I find it? I will give you
any thing&mdash;any thing for this Elixir of
Beauty.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the witch told her, if she would
promise to be her slave one day in every
month, she would help her to procure the
great treasure.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can buy the old woman off when I
become the bride of the rich prince,&#8221;
thought the young girl. So she promised,
and the witch brought out a wrinkled
yellow parchment, and wrote the contract.
Piercing the maiden&#8217;s arm, she dipped the
pen in the blood, and the consul&#8217;s daughter
signed it with a trembling hand.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>&#8220;That is good,&#8221; said the old witch, her
red eyes glaring at the maiden. &#8220;Now
you must go to the summit of the black
mountain, just over the prince&#8217;s mine, and
bring me a quart of the snow that has
drifted round the roots of the blasted pine.
All your gold and jewelry you must bring,
and, at twelve o&#8217;clock to-morrow night,
come to the cavern, and I will give you
the Elixir of Beauty, the wonderful golden
snow.&#8221;</p>

<p>The consul&#8217;s daughter took off all her
jewelry, necklace, bracelets, and all the
gold she had she gave to the old witch.
Then she toiled up the steep mountain,
and at last, weary and worn, returned with
the snow from the roots of the blasted
pine.</p>

<p>When the young girl had left the cavern,
the woman bent over the blazing fire, with
alembic and crucible. &#8220;Who can tell the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
wonderful mystery,&#8221; she muttered to herself,
as the liquid boiled up yellow as gold.
&#8220;I myself will wash in it, and become
young and fair again.&#8221;</p>

<p>The night came on in darkness, and at
eleven o&#8217;clock the old witch carried the
liquid out in the chill air, and with her
red eyes, that could see best in the darkness,
watched it as it changed in form, till,
just as the bell in the church tower rung
out twelve, she saw before her the Elixir
of Beauty, the magic golden snow.</p>

<p>Just at that moment she heard the voice
of the consul&#8217;s daughter calling, &#8220;It is so
dark, I cannot see; give me your hand,
and lead me to the Elixir of Beauty. I
have dared so much for it! I am almost
dead with fright.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In a moment,&#8221; answered the old woman,
and she slipped the golden snow into a crevice
in the rock, leaving only a little for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
maiden. Reaching out her hand, she led
the trembling girl into the cavern, and,
taking an ivory box, filled it with pure
white snow. Sprinkling over it the remnant
of the Elixir of Beauty, she gave it
to the maiden, saying, &#8220;Wash in it, and
you will become as lovely as the dawn.&#8221;</p>

<p>When the young girl opened the box,
it looked to her yellow and shiny, for the
old witch had cast a glamour over it, so
she went away quite satisfied.</p>

<p>She concealed her treasure in her private
closet, and every night, after all in the
house had retired, she washed her face,
and, because there was the remnant of the
Elixir of Beauty in it, she became fairer
every day. All who saw her wondered,
and said, &#8220;Surely the consul&#8217;s daughter is
the most beautiful maiden!&#8221;</p>

<p>Through the whole week the herald of
the prince rode over the Gold Land, everywhere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
seeking for Golden Snow. Once he
passed the fisherman&#8217;s cottage, but that
morning the fisher folk and their adopted
child had gone down to the beach. As
chance would have it, they missed the
messenger.</p>

<p>Again the castle was illuminated, and
the guests were assembled.</p>

<p>There were beautiful maidens, but the
consul&#8217;s daughter shone like the morning.
Again the heart of the prince re-echoed the
wondering admiration of the guests, and
his deep dark eyes flashed with a strange
magnetic fire.</p>

<p>As the evening advanced, it grew warm,
with the great lights flashing everywhere,
and the delicious notes of the music vibrating
and thrilling in every form.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do not open the windows,&#8221; entreated
the consul&#8217;s daughter, &#8220;for the snow-flakes
are drifting with the wind, and the night<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
air is chill.&#8221; A shudder passed over her,
so they opened only the doors of the grand
saloon. But one of the warm and weary
dancers went out secretly, and opened the
carved oval window of the great hall.
Then, louder than ever, the clear voices
floated into the hall, and in all the winding
corridors found a hundred echoes, till the
whole castle reverberated with them:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;The consul&#8217;s daughter is fair, we know,</div>
<div class="verse">But not like the princess Golden Snow.</div>
<div class="verse">There are lovely maids at the castle ball,</div>
<div class="verse">But Golden Snow is fairer than all.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>The consul&#8217;s daughter was again frantic
with rage; her eyes glared with fury, and
her face grew frightful with the heat of
passion. The dream had passed forever
from the heart of the prince, and he wondered
that, only a moment before, he had
thought the face, so contorted with anger,
beautiful as a painter&#8217;s bright ideal.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>Everywhere they searched, but could
find no one, so, while the mystery deepened,
the ball ended.</p>

<p>In the morning, the prince mounted a
fine black horse, and started off as for a
long journey. For months he wandered
over the northern Gold Land, seeking
everywhere the princess Golden Snow.</p>

<p>At last, when he had given up all hope,
and was returning disappointed to the
castle, he chanced to ride by the fisherman&#8217;s
cottage. The old fisher folk sat in
the corner mending a net, and Golden
Snow, in her rich, marvelous voice, was
singing to them one of the songs of the
sea. The prince stopped his horse and
listened, drinking in every note of the
delicious melody. When it was ended, he
dismounted, and, leading his horse by the
bridle, knocked at the door, and the good-wife
opened it.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>&#8220;Tell me, good mother, who it was
singing, for, in all my life, never a voice
came so into my heart.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was the princess Golden Snow,&#8221; answered
the old woman, proudly.</p>

<p>The prince entered, and saw Golden
Snow in all her matchless grace and beauty.
Around her head was her crown of
shining hair, decked with brilliants, and a
mantle of the richest fur covered her. She
had only just returned from the sea-shore,
with the rich flush of exercise upon her
cheek, and her eyes were beaming with
the rare beauty of her gentle spirit.</p>

<p>The fisherman rose to meet the young
prince, who told him, in his handsome,
manly way, how all over the north land
he had been seeking for the princess
Golden Snow; and how at last, when
hope was almost dying, he had found the
treasure.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>The old man listened gravely; then he
placed the white hand of the maiden in
the young man&#8217;s strong, true palm, saying,
&#8220;Not because you are a Russian prince,
but because you are one of God&#8217;s noblemen,
I give you my dear child. Take her,
for in her loving heart she is the most
beautiful maiden.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thus the young people were betrothed
in the cottage of the good fisher folk, and,
when the news spread over the country,
there was great rejoicing. They were married
at the old church, where the stones
are covered with lichens, and many a poor
man&#8217;s heart was made glad by the generosity
of the prince that day.</p>

<p>The consul&#8217;s daughter was too angry to
join in the festivities, but all the former
guests of the castle were there, and among
them sat the fisher folk in the place of
honor.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>All over the northern Gold Land flew
the joyous snow-flakes, dancing at the
wedding of their princess.</p>

<p>Everywhere in the grand saloon, and
through the winding corridors of the castle,
with strains of rich music mingled the
clear mysterious voices:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;All the north land now shall know,</div>
<div class="verse">The most beautiful maiden is Golden Snow.</div>
<div class="verse">We are her sisters, snow-flakes white,</div>
<div class="verse">She is the princess of golden light.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>Thus all were happy, save the consul&#8217;s
daughter, whose pride and rage devoured
her. For one day every month she was
doomed to be the slave of the wicked old
witch, which was wretchedness. At last,
one night, when her tasks had been too
hard for endurance, from her great weariness
and sickness of heart, she cried out,
&#8220;O Lord Christ, forgive and pity me!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the old witch gave a wild shriek<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
of madness, and disappeared in the black
shadows of the cañon forever.</p>

<p>Because she had hidden part of the
golden snow, by this prayer the maiden
was delivered out of her hands.</p>

<p>The selfish pride of the consul&#8217;s daughter
was humbled, and she grew so gentle
and good, that all, even the poor and dependent,
learned to love her, so that she,
too, became, in heart, a beautiful maiden.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">GRACIA AND CATRINA.</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Near</span> the Mission of San Diego lived a
very wealthy Spaniard and his wife, the
most beautiful señora in all the country
for many miles around.</p>

<p>They had every thing about them to
make life pleasant: a fine orange and lemon
grove; a large garden, containing olive,
almond, peach, and pear trees; indeed, all
kinds of fruit and flowers, that the luxurious
climate of San Diego produces.</p>

<p>Their house was pleasant, and furnished
with all the comforts and many of the
luxuries of life; and when God blessed
them with a little daughter, they felt as
though there was nothing left to wish for.
The child resembled her beautiful mamma<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
in features as much as the tiny bud is like
the full-blown rose.</p>

<p>The hidalgo had never ceased to regard
his wife with that kind of worshipful love
so dear to woman&#8217;s heart; and his great
delight was to watch tenderly over mother
and child, that even the slightest wish
might not pass ungratified.</p>

<p>As it grew older, the little one learned
to recognize the glance of love; and when
at last it would open its large dark eyes
and look eagerly at the dear papa, and,
holding out its tiny hands, crow with all
the innocent delight of infancy, he would
take the babe in his arms, and all the
harsh lines about his mouth softened into
smiles. He was happier than any one in
the whole country, except the delighted
mother, who was never weary of looking
upon the darling of her heart.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_064f.jpg" alt="Gracia and Catrina" /></div>
<p class="caption"><i>Gracia and Catrina.</i></p>

<p>The señora was a devout Catholic, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
though she seldom left the child alone
with her nurse, as the feast of Corpus
Christi approached, she felt that this year,
above all others so blessed to her in the
birth of her beloved child, she should
assist in the celebration. On the morning
of the holy day, she gave her treasure,
with many charges, into the care of the
old servant, bidding her on no account
whatever to leave the child, even for a
moment. Twice, as she was about leaving,
she returned to embrace the little one,
with her soft eyes filled with tears. As
she covered the face of her babe with
kisses, she whispered, &#8220;Mamma loves thee.
<i>Mijita mia.</i> Foolish mamma trembles to
leave thee, yet the divine eye of the Holy
Mother will watch over thee. <i>Mia vida,
mia vida!</i>&#8221; Then came the sound of music,
and the voice of the hidalgo calling
her; so with a last embrace, with mingled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
smiles and tears, the young mother parted
from her little one, for the first time since
its birth.</p>

<p>There was to be a large procession
formed upon the plaza, where rustic booths
were built, and ornamented according to
the taste and wealth of the devout, who
often sacrificed the comfort of weeks, to be
able to give this tribute of honor to the
Holy Mother and the Blessed Christ.</p>

<p>Pictures of the Madonna were placed
upon the rude altars, entwined with beautiful
wreaths, while rare flowers shed their
rich incense from costly vases. The señora
had spared neither money nor pains.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is in honor of the Merciful Christ&mdash;the
Redeemer of the world,&#8221; she said;
&#8220;let every thing be as worthy of His
greatness as possible; it will fall far short
of what my thankful heart would offer.&#8221;</p>

<p>Pictures from the hands of the old masters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
were brought from the house, with
tapestry and fringes; and every thing that
the luxurious climate produced was added,
until nothing seemed wanting to make it
the one booth of enchanting beauty.</p>

<p>The señora superintended the arrangement
of all, while the señor sat a little
apart, watching with delight the magic
workings of her exquisite taste and refinement.
All this time the nurse held the
infant in her arms, singing quaint old
Indian ballads, rocking her to and fro
with a soothing motion, till at last the
restless fingers were stilled and the pretty
eyes closed. The little one slept, and
dreamed, no doubt, such dreams as the
loving God sends to guileless infancy.</p>

<p>Just then the procession started, and
the music fell upon the ear of the young
Indian girl who was always near to wait
upon old Macata, the nurse.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>&#8220;Macata,&#8221; she said, as she started lightly
from the mat on which she was sitting, &#8220;it
touches my heart; I must go! See, the
baby sleeps. Nothing can harm it. Come,
mother Macata, only for a moment!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing can harm it,&#8221; said the old Indian,
as she laid the child in its little
straw cradle, for she, too, loved the festive
sight and glad music of the <i>fête</i>.</p>

<p>She had wished, of all things, to join
the gossips of the mission on the plaza,
but, since that could not be, she saw no
reason, while the child was sleeping so
sweetly, that she should not go to the
garden wall, and for a few moments catch
a passing glimpse of the gay procession.
She bent over the child, patting it softly
with her great strong hand, and singing
in a low voice:&mdash;</p>



<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;Sleep! baby, sleep!</div>
<div class="verse">While I softly creep</div>
<div class="verse">To the roadside near;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></div>
<div class="verse">Sleep, baby, dear.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>The little form was so still and peaceful.
Surely there could be no danger! So the
nurse, who loved her dearly, knelt down
and kissed her very lightly, saying, in the
Indian tongue,</p>

<p>&#8220;Master of life, preserve the little white
rosebud.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again she pressed her dusky lips to the
sweet little face, so peaceful in its innocent
repose, then ran away through the garden
to the roadside, with her companion, the
bright-eyed Indian girl.</p>

<p>It was a rare sight in the eyes of these
simple Indians, that long procession, with
its swelling music and waving banners.
All the Indian lads and maidens in the
country were there, dressed in their gala
attire, while the bright-colored handkerchiefs
and shawls of the more rustic señoras,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
as they rode by on horseback, added
not a little to the festive scene.</p>

<p>For full fifteen minutes they sat watching
the procession, crouching behind the
garden wall, that the señora might not see
them. Well they knew her eyes would be
attracted by the magnetism of love to her
child and home.</p>

<p>&#8220;See, mother Macata,&#8221; said the young
girl, sorrowfully, &#8220;there are all my mates,
while I am here. Oh! how I wish I could
go with them!&#8221;</p>

<p>Just then the señora passed, and, mid
all the joy of the occasion, Macata saw a
look of deep solicitude in her face as she
turned toward the house. &#8220;We must go,&#8221;
said the old woman, taking the hand of
the young girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;Only one moment,&#8221; replied the maiden;
and while old Macata yielded, she could
not suppress an emotion of uneasiness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
which the señora&#8217;s look had nervously
roused.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now! now!&#8221; said the old woman,
nervously, as again she clasped the hand
of the girl, and dragged her away from the
attractive scene.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know the baby sleeps,&#8221; said the
girl, pettishly; but Macata, in her uneasiness,
hurried onward.</p>

<p>They passed through the pleasant garden
into the silent house, and the softly
shaded room where they had left the sleeping
child. There stood the dainty little
cradle, but the child was gone!</p>

<p>At first they thought some of the servants
had returned and taken it to some
other room; but when they had searched
the whole house, and ran, calling in vain,
through the garden, they were almost wild
with fright.</p>

<p>Tears streamed from the eyes of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
young girl as she looked helplessly into
the face of old Macata, who tore her long
hair, and moaned piteously. She could
not cease looking, although it seemed
hopeless.</p>

<p>&#8220;In so short a time to disappear, and
leave no trace behind to aid this search!&#8221;
The child! The poor little innocent child
she loved so dearly, gone, she knew not
where! How could she meet the father
and mother?</p>

<p>Thus, full of despair, she ran about,
looking in vain, and calling wildly upon
her darling, until the señor and his wife
returned.</p>

<p>To picture the scene that followed would
be impossible. The torturing grief of the
unhappy father was mingled with all the
terrors of suspense, and the desolate heart
of the sorrowing mother refused to be
comforted. Day and night she sobbed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
bitterly, &#8220;Would that God had taken my
baby to himself!&#8221;</p>

<p>The whole country was roused. The
search continued for many days, till hope
died out in every heart. Then it was that
a fearful fever seized the mother, exhausted
by grief, want of sleep, and the fatigues of
a hopeless search. For weeks her life was
despaired of; and when at last the fever
left her, the light had gone from her eye,
the smile from her lips, and the hope of
happiness from her heart.</p>

<p>The old Macata never left her side. At
first the mother shuddered when she came
near; but as she looked upon the hair of
the old woman, which, since the loss of the
child, had become white as the driven
snow, her heart softened, and she shed her
first tears upon the bosom of the penitent
and sorrowing nurse.</p>

<p>For many weeks the luxury of tears had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
been denied her, and, from that first bursting
of the flood-gates of her grief, she
could not bear the old Indian long out of
her sight. A mutual sorrow bound their
hearts together.</p>

<p>Macata could never do enough for the
dear, sad señora, but sometimes she would
go to her, saying, &#8220;Bless me now, señora
dear; I am going to look for our baby.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the señora would bless her, and
say, &#8220;Go, my poor Macata.&#8221;</p>

<p>All day long she roamed through woods,
down deep into the shadowy cañons, or
upon the mountain tops. After weary
hours, and sometimes days, of fruitless
search, she would return, worn and heart-broken
with her vain wanderings. Kneeling
before the señora, weeping, and wringing
her hands, she would cry, &#8220;Oh! dear
señora, forgive me! I have not found our
baby. I lost it, but I will find it. I will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
find it before I die, so help me, Wacondah,
Great Spirit!&#8221;</p>

<p>Often the old woman fell fainting at the
feet of her beloved señora, who would
have her raised tenderly and placed upon
the bed, where for hours she sat by her,
watching and weeping.</p>

<p>Thus these two sorrowing ones, the
broken-hearted mother and the grief-crazed
nurse, became very dear to each other.</p>

<p>The father mourned deeply, but to the
heart of man time brings its softening
balm. He loved his wife fondly, and, for
her sake, sometimes tried to waken a hope
that the child might be restored to them.
Yet within his shadowed heart he mourned
the precious one as dead.</p>

<p>Very sadly he missed the tiny outstretched
hands that once were sure to
greet him, and that radiant little face that
was all the world to him; and as months<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
and years went by, whenever he looked
upon a little maiden full of grace and
beauty, he would press his hand to his
heart in sorrow, for &#8220;what might have
been.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sometimes the señora, leaning her weary
head on his breast, would say: &#8220;I shall
know my darling, no matter how many
years shall pass before we meet.&#8221; Then
she would clasp her hands, exclaiming:
&#8220;What if I should die before Macata finds
her? Then, oh! then, I shall know her in
heaven,&#8221; she would bow her head lower
upon the beloved breast in prayer. Thus
she would remain till the tender voice of
the hidalgo aroused her; then she would
clasp her thin hands about his neck, and
look pityingly into his eyes to see the sorrow
of her heart reflected there.</p>

<p>Thus it was with the parents as the years
passed sadly by, but all the while the seasons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
went and came again; the sunshine
gladdened the earth; the rainbow beautified
the shower; the flowers blossomed in the
garden; and young hearts beat happily as
theirs upon their bridal day.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On that bright morning of the <i>fête</i> of
Corpus Christi, which resulted so unfortunately
for the hidalgo and the poor señora,
Macata had not noticed that the garden
gate was left unlocked, nor in her haste did
she see the crouching form of a fierce-looking
woman hiding behind the lime-tree.</p>

<p>No sooner was she and the young girl
out of sight than the woman rose stealthily,
and gathering up her coarse brown
cloak around her, glided swiftly through
the garden and into the room where the
cradle stood, still moving from the parting
motion of Macata&#8217;s hand. Glancing hastily
around, she snatched up the still sleeping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
child, and wrapping it in the folds of her
cloak, ran out of the garden, away from the
road, on through the orange-grove, and before
Macata and the girl returned, was far
away out of sight.</p>

<p>Still on she went, through the vineyard,
and over the hill beyond; nor did she
pause for a moment after she entered the
thick wood, until miles away in the dusk
of the evening, deep down in a cañon she
came to a rude cottage overhung with trees
and rocks.</p>

<p>All day long the delicate child had
been out in the burning sunshine, tasting
nothing but a tortilla moistened in
water.</p>

<p>When they entered the cottage she had
cried herself to sleep, and her little head
rested wearily upon the bosom of the
woman who had stolen her from her mother
and her happy home.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>On the floor sat a little girl shelling
beans. She was a poor, misshapen child of
misfortune, with a sad mark of suffering
upon her face, which, when the woman entered,
deepened.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take this child, Catrina. Put it away
anywhere&mdash;anywhere out of sight. It is
hateful to me.&#8221; Then throwing off the
brown cloak, and rubbing her hands, she
drew near the fire, adding: &#8220;Be in a hurry,
girl. Give me my supper, for I am tired
and hungry.&#8221;</p>

<p>The young girl had taken the little one and
laid it upon the bed, and, though there was
an expression of surprise upon her face, she
placed the supper upon the table without
speaking. Then, placing chairs, she and
the woman sat down together. Still not a
word was spoken. By and by, after they
had eaten, and the dishes were washed, the
hearth swept, and more fagots heaped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
upon the fire, the girl pointed to the sleeping
child.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let her be,&#8221; said the woman, crossly.
&#8220;I can not support you in idleness. Go
shell your beans.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl placed a cup of milk at the fire,
sat down again to her task, and, for a long
time, nothing was heard but the crackling
pods. At length the woman spoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is little use in talking to you, Catrina:
but I must speak sometimes, and
you are the only being I have, about me,
and you can not tell what I say. You can
not remember, Catrina! Many years ago
I was beautiful; I was young. Now I am
old, not with years! See this hair once so
glossy&mdash;look at it.&#8221;</p>

<p>She caught out the comb with an angry
grasp, and all over her neck and shoulders
fell the heavy tangles of long, gray hair.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was young, beautiful, and beloved.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
Oh, it seems an age of years ago! I have
been so wretched since. That child&#8217;s father
caused his death! I lived! God knows
how till your father came, and I married
him. For love? Oh, no, for the poor protection
that woman&#8217;s nature craves and a shelter
from despair. But even this failed me!</p>

<p>&#8220;What a life for both! But I am revenged,
ha! ha! They will wait long for
their pretty darling, now.&#8221; The woman
laughed wildly, and such a look of hate
and exultation covered her face, that, in the
fitful fire-light, was almost fiendish.</p>

<p>Catrina dropped her hands on her lap,
and shuddered, while her eyes were fixed
upon the wretched woman with a kind of
fascination.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go to work! go to work! I say, you
stupid little witch, what are you staring at?
You look as if you were frightened out of
the little sense you have.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>Again the woman laughed a strange
laugh, that grated harshly upon the ear of
the unfortunate girl. Tears filled her eyes,
but still no reply.</p>

<p>Poor child! she had never spoken one
word in her short but sorrowful life. She
was only the poor little step-daughter of
the woman, and since the death of her
father she had been unhappy.</p>

<p>The noise had awakened the little one,
and opening her large eyes, she looked
around first with wonder, and then with
fear, at the strange place and strange faces
before her. The woman rose and took her
in her arms.</p>

<p>&#8220;So, little chick, you are awake, and how
do you think your lady mamma feels now,
and your proud papa? Ha! ha! he never
thought how I felt, when years ago he
brought death to my heart, nor will I think
of him.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>Slowly she began swaying the child to
and fro, talking fiercely all the while. The
tiny lips of the baby quivered, as, for a moment,
she suppressed her cry, then a pitiful
wail filled the cottage.</p>

<p>Catrina was preparing the bowl of bread
and milk, and as she approached, the little
one held out her hands, and when Catrina
took her she hid her face in her bosom and
sobbed softly. The child was hungry, and
as the girl offered her the bread and milk,
she ate it eagerly, but all the while her
frightened gaze was fixed upon the face of
the woman, who seemed to grow uneasy
before the pitiful terror of those innocent
eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is always so now. Even this child
shrinks from me, and I don&#8217;t mean to harm
her. She has her bread and milk here, if it
is not in a silver bowl. Ah! my heart is
of stone, now&mdash;of stone!&#8221; and instinctively<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
she folded her arms over her bosom, and,
rocking herself, gazed into the fire as though
she were reading the future in its fitful
embers.</p>

<p>No wonder that the child, used only to
tenderness, looked fearfully upon that pale,
dark face, grown prematurely old. Her hair
still hung over her shoulders, a long and
tangled mass, all its purple luster, all its
beauty gone forever. There was a strange,
wild look about the eyes, and under them
a dark, sunken circle. Far into the night
she sat brooding over the glowing embers,
till they were turned to blackened
cinders.</p>

<p>That night Catrina had a more pleasant
dream than she had known since her father
died.</p>

<p>After the little one had eaten her supper,
Catrina undressed her, and wrapping her
in a blanket, placed her in her own bed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
patting her caressingly with her hand till
she fell asleep.</p>

<p>Catrina lay down beside her, and soon
she dreamed that an angel came to the cottage
and changed the darkness to light,
that even her step-mother&#8217;s face grew gentle
and tender, and her voice soft and low in
that blessed presence. Her own weary
heart grew light, and as she looked fondly
at this angel, full of gratitude for her new-born
happiness, she saw only the child before
her, but clearly she heard these words,
in the well-remembered tones of her father&#8217;s
voice, saying:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;This child shall be the angel of the
house.&#8221; She awoke to find her face bathed
in tears, and kissed the baby a hundred
times, and in her silence prayed God to
bless the darling.</p>

<p>Already the joy of an angel&#8217;s presence
filled her heart. Poor little Catrina! She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
was only a child of ten years, yet her face
looked pinched, old, and careworn. This
was not strange for the work of the cottage
fell to her small hands, and there was no
one to say: &#8220;You have done well, my little
Catrina.&#8221;</p>

<p>She could not remember her own gentle
mother, nor when the step-mother came to
them, but she never forgot the sad face of
the dear papa, when he used to put his
hand upon her tangled hair, saying: &#8220;Catrina,
you will miss papa; no one else but
my poor little desolate <i>Mijita mia, Mijita
mia</i>.&#8221; Then he would turn to hide the tears
that would not be driven back. In those
days of illness he was helpless as Catrina
in her babyhood.</p>

<p>One day, when the step-mother had been
gone since the dawning, the father seemed
to sleep, Catrina sat very silently for many
hours, for young as she was, she did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
wish to disturb poor sick papa when sleeping.
She grew very weary, but still he did
not wake; so she ran softly to the bedside,
and looked at him till her heart grew faint.
He lay so still, and was very pale; and
when she climbed up and laid her little
face against his, she shuddered and wept
bitterly, it was so very cold. After a while
the step-mother returned. Soon some men
came and took the father away, and though
they looked very rough, one of them stopped
and gave her a tortilla, saying: &#8220;Poor
little young one, she has lost her best
friend.&#8221;</p>

<p>As soon as the little girl could do
any thing, the step-mother gave her
plenty of work. Thus the years went
by till the eve of the <i>fête</i> of Corpus
Christi, when baby Gracia was brought
to the cottage.</p>

<p>It seemed like the dawn of a new life to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
the lonely Catrina to look into that sweet
baby face, and when the little one learned
to love her and cry for her, though she
found her task much heavier, her heart
grew so light that her little hands worked
wonders.</p>

<p>The woman took off the pretty coral
necklace and sleeve clasps, and all the
child&#8217;s fine clothes, and placed them in the
strong oaken chest at the head of her bed.
Little Gracia was dressed in clothes coarse
as Catrina&#8217;s, but still she grew more lovely
every day, and looked like a little princess
in her rags.</p>

<p>Even the seared heart of the woman softened
to the winning ways of the pretty
child, though sometimes she would drive
her away, exclaiming: &#8220;Go, go from me&mdash;I
hate the race.&#8221; At other times she would
take her in her arms, saying: &#8220;The baby
is not to blame,&#8221; and with tears dimming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
her eyes, cover the little face with fond
caresses.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Thus passed five long years at the cottage.
Catrina had grown stronger, and
more shapely. Her face was full of love
and tenderness, though exposure had made
her skin very rough and brown. Gracia
had changed from babyhood to a sportive
child, graceful as a young fawn.</p>

<p>One rainy night the woman came home
very late, leaning heavily upon the arm
of an old Indian, who with great difficulty
supported her trembling steps. She was
very ill, and she felt the cold shadow of
death falling upon her.</p>

<p>Gracia was asleep, but Catrina sat by
the fire waiting, and keeping the supper
hot. She was frightened when she saw
the pale face of the step-mother, and trembled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
with fear as she helped the Indian
to lay her upon the bed.</p>

<p>For a few moments the sick woman was
silent from exhaustion, but after a time
she called Catrina to her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen to me, Catrina, for my time is
growing short. I have been cruel to you
at times, but you have been always good
and true. Forgive me now, my poor Catrina
as you pray the good Lord to forgive
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here the woman grew so faint that
she was obliged to stop speaking, and
Catrina wept as though her heart would
break.</p>

<p>Poor girl! she had been hardly used,
but she knew no other fate; and though
she did not love the step-mother as she did
the little Gracia, it seemed very desolate
to sit there by the dying woman who had
given her a home, poor though it was.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
She pressed the cold hand to her lips, and
buried her head in the bed-clothes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! that child!&#8221; gasped the wretched
woman. &#8220;Catrina, I have no time to lose.
I see every thing so differently.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have been crazy, but all is clear now.
Catrina, when you think of me remember
me only as a poor suffering woman, and
forgive me, as you hope for God&#8217;s mercy.</p>

<p>&#8220;But the child! in that trunk you will
find her clothes and papers which will
prove her birth. Her father is a good and
true man, as I have learned this day. My
life&#8217;s great wrong came from another&#8217;s
hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Promise me, Catrina, that you will
never rest till you have restored her to her
home, and the parents who love her.&#8221;</p>

<p>The step-mother&#8217;s words grew fainter,
but her eyes, full of the brightness of
expiring fires, were fixed upon Catrina,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
who reverently made the sign of the cross,
and bowed her head in solemn acquiescence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Catrina,&#8221; she continued, &#8220;go up to
the cañon, keeping to the right, then over
the mountain path, till you come to the
great wood.&#8221; A spasm of pain convulsed
her, and she ceased speaking. In a few
moments it passed away, and a calm
happy smile settled upon her face.</p>

<p>&#8220;I repent of all my sins; I forgive even
the murderer of him who was dearer than
my life. Now, may God have mercy upon
my soul.&#8221;</p>

<p>The husky voice was hushed, the clasped
hands relaxed, and the suffering woman
was dead!</p>

<p>&#8220;She has gone to the land of the Great
Spirit, and He has blessed her,&#8221; said the
Indian, filled with amazement to see the
troubled face grow so calm in death.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>They buried her in the shadow of the
deep cañon, and the children were left
alone. The kind Indian came every day
to the cottage to look after them, bringing
always a bag of tortillas and fruits.</p>

<p>One morning, about a week after the
death of the step-mother, he found Catrina
and Gracia just leaving the cottage. As
he gave Catrina the tortillas she shook
his hand long and kindly, and the tears
glistened in her eyes, but she could not
speak to tell him she was going away,
never to rest, until she had led Gracia
back to her home.</p>

<p>For many days the Indian returned with
his bag of tortillas, and went sadly away,
for the cottage was alone in the dusky
shadows.</p>

<p>The children took the path to the right
out of the cañon, then on up the steep
mountain way. Catrina carried Gracia&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
baby-clothes in her arms, and a large bag
of tortillas, for she had eaten sparingly for
a week, that she might have food for a
long journey.</p>

<p>After awhile Gracia became weary, and
then Catrina took her in her arms, though
they seemed full, but the willing heart
found a ready way to help her darling.</p>

<p>At last they reached the top of the
mountain, so very worn and weary, that
after they had eaten their dinners, Gracia
fell heavily upon Catrina&#8217;s lap, but she
could no longer support the weight of the
child; so, folding her in her arms, they lay
down upon the soft turf together and slept
as soundly as though it had been a bed of
down.</p>

<p>The shadows were growing very long
when the young girls awoke, and all the
west was glowing with fleecy amber
clouds. The sunset in the clear pure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
atmosphere of the mountains seemed so
much more rich and beautiful than in the
dim cañon, that little Gracia&#8217;s eyes shone
with delight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! Catrina,&#8221; she exclaimed, &#8220;surely
that is the glorious heaven we see before
us. Do you not remember what the good
padre told us, when he came to the cottage?
Let us hurry, Catrina, &#8217;tis not so
very far. Perhaps we can get there before
dark.&#8221;</p>

<p>Catrina caught the hand of the excited
child, and making the sign of the cross,
knelt down with her face toward the sunset,
and prayed for the soul of the unhappy
step-mother, for the little Gracia,
whom she loved dearly, and last of all for
herself.</p>

<p>The radiance of the sunset fell upon the
poor dumb girl, and shed its shining
beauty upon her face. When Catrina<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
arose, Gracia looked at her with eyes full
of eager wonder.</p>

<p>&#8220;How God loves you, Catrina,&#8221; she
whispered. &#8220;He threw his glory all
around you when you prayed.&#8221; Catrina
smiled and kissed the child, and giving
her a tortilla, they began to descend the
mountain, but the twilight came on so fast
that very soon they could hardly see their
way.</p>

<p>Gracia clasped Catrina&#8217;s hand very
closely, saying: &#8220;I should be afraid in the
dark, only God loves you so much, and
heaven is so near.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thus they went on as long as they could
see, and then sat down in the darkness,
and by and by slept again.</p>

<p>Catrina woke early in the morning, and
seeing a lime-tree not far distant, covered
with fruit, left Gracia sleeping, and ran to
gather some. &#8220;It will be so nice with our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
dry tortillas,&#8221; she thought; &#8220;and dear Gracia
will be pleased with the juicy fruit.&#8221;</p>

<p>She made great haste, fearing lest the
child might wake, and be frightened at
her absence, and in a short time she returned
with her apron filled with the
delicious fruit. Her face lighted with the
smile of grateful love, as she saw the little
girl still sleeping sweetly. A moment
more and the happy smile was turned to
an expression of intense horror.</p>

<p>Only a few feet from the child crouched
the huge form of an immense cougar, his
fierce eyes gloating with hungry fire upon
his helpless prey.</p>

<p>Catrina remained transfixed for a moment,
watching the wild beast, until he
crouched to spring upon her darling; she
then threw her arms over her head,
rushed forward, and by what means, God
knows, her intense terror burst the prison-bonds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
of sound, and the dumb girl gave
one wild, shrill cry, that made the mountains
echo.</p>

<p>Just at that moment came a sharp flash
of light, and the cougar lay weltering in
his blood.</p>

<p>The startled Gracia woke to find Catrina
lying as one dead upon the ground,
and a handsome young boy coming forward
to help them. The little girl was
much frightened, and, weeping bitterly,
she threw her arms around Catrina and
called piteously,&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Catrina! Catrina! open your
eyes; do not leave me, Catrina; God loves
you, He has called you!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Catrina opened her eyes, and said,
with imperfect utterance, &#8220;Don&#8217;t cry, my
darling. The cougar is dead. Don&#8217;t cry;
he will not hurt you.&#8221; And she kissed
Gracia, and cried as hard as the child.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>&#8220;You! Catrina, you speak!&#8221; exclaimed
little Gracia, as soon as she could speak,
for Catrina&#8217;s caresses.</p>

<p>&#8220;You speak, who never spoke in your
life. The good God heard your prayer
last night. He shed His glory upon you,
and now you speak.&#8221; They embraced
each other, and wept for joy.</p>

<p>Then they noticed the handsome boy
standing near them, resting upon his gun,
and Catrina pressed his hand to her lips,
and thanked him again and again.</p>

<p>They all went to look at the cougar
together, and Catrina told the wondering
Gracia how very near to heaven she had
been, and young Leon De Lande told them
both how he had started by moonlight to
hunt in the mountains, and how he
thanked God he had been able to save the
little señorita.</p>

<p>They sat down to eat their tortillas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
and fruit, and then started for the valley.
Poor Catrina! How delightful to be
able to talk, though she needed practice
to be able to speak plainly.</p>

<p>She was like a little child just learning,
but she managed to let Leon know all
about Gracia, and he, with delighted
surprise, told her that he knew her father,
who was the richest señor in all the country,
and that in a few hours they could
reach the vineyard.</p>

<p>Never were there happier young people
than went down the mountain together.
As they entered the wood, whom should
they meet but poor old nurse, Macata,
hunting for her lost darling.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have found the little señorita for you,
good Macata,&#8221; said Leon. Macata gave
one glance at Gracia, then caught her in
her arms, exclaiming, &#8220;<i>Ninita mia! Ninita
mia! Waconda!</i> the Master of Life has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
heard my cry! I knew you were not lost
for ever.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old Indian started off at full speed,
carrying Gracia in her arms, sobbing all
the time, and blessing the Great Spirit
that she had lived to restore the lost child
to the dear señora.</p>

<p>Leon and Catrina could barely keep pace
with her, but at last they entered the very
room, where, five years before, the beautiful
child lay sleeping in her little willow
cradle.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have brought her back, señora,&#8221; cried
old Macata, out of breath. &#8220;It is our little
white bud, señora, dear! Oh! <i>Alma mia!
Mijita mia</i>, Waconda has not forgotten
us!&#8221; The old woman placed the child in
the mother&#8217;s arms, and fell with her face
upon the floor, weeping for joy.</p>

<p>No words can tell the joy that filled the
house. Only the heart of the father and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
mother could feel how greatly God had
blessed them.</p>

<p>Now the years went pleasantly by. The
good Catrina become a lovely maiden.
Her form gained strength and beauty.
Her hair grew soft and glossy; her skin
clear and smooth, and her brown eyes
were tender with the light of happiness.
But, most wonderful of all, her voice was a
marvel of sweetness. It was a great
pleasure to hear her sing at evening, accompanied
by the soft music of her light
guitar. She was loved by all, but especially
so by the young hidalgo, who won
her for his bride.</p>

<p>Leon and Gracia danced together at the
wedding, and it was plain enough to see
how devoted the brave young señor was
to the graceful señorita whose life he had
saved.</p>

<p>Gracia had grown more and more beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
every year, till in all the country she
was called <i>La Bonita</i>.</p>

<p>She had many admirers, but the señor
said, &#8220;Young Leon restored her to us, and
to him only will we give our child.&#8221; Thus,
upon her sixteenth birthday, the great
wedding feast was made, and all San Diego
around re-echoed the great joy. There
were tables spread under the lime-trees
for the poor, and all the country was
there.</p>

<p>In the quaint adobe church the marriage
ceremony was performed, and with a
happy heart Leon received his bride, while
the father and mother thanked God for
His most blessed gifts, their son and
daughter. Thus all their sorrows ended,
and all their lives were circled by the light
of happiness and love.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE DANCING SUNBEAM.</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> a dark, narrow street of the city stood
a dingy tenement house. Many people lived
within, and called it by the dear name of
home; yet it was very different from the
luxurious homes of the rich, surrounded
by pleasant gardens, filled with costly pictures,
and a thousand beautiful things very
delightful to possess. Nor was it like the
comfortable homes of the middle class,
where the fire burns brightly in the polished
grate, and the table is always plentifully
spread. Oh, no! The people in the
tenement house were all poor, from the
first floor front to the attic back, which
was the worst of all.</p>

<p>It was the rainy season, and through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
the roof, round the chimney, and between
the cracked and loosened weather-boards,
came the driving rain.</p>

<p>Then there was a continual opening and
shutting of doors; and at the common entrance,
all day long and far into the night,
there was somebody always coming in, or
going out, letting in the chilling blast, that
rushed through the muddy halls, and into
the rooms, pinching the sick and old in a
pitiless way.</p>

<p>Altogether, it was not a pleasant place
to live in; but most of the people in the
tenement house had always been poor, and
had learned to be content with what the
day brought them, so they were not hungry.
Only one in the house had known
the luxury of being very rich, and she was
now the poorest of them all.</p>

<p>Just under the roof she sat, wearily
stitching upon the coarse work that must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
bring bread to her little child. How the
rain pattered and clattered upon the roof,
as the daintily-bred woman bent above her
unaccustomed task, thinking over the old
thoughts, that made the present more than
desolate.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was not so once,&#8221; said the rain.
&#8220;The old home, how comfortable and
beautiful it was! There you were a fair
lady with lily-white hands; now, you are
the same, only one can not think so.
There are silver threads in your hair, and
your hands are too red. People say:
&#8216;What a pity the woman with the pretty
child is so poor!&#8217; but they do not help
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The old home! the old home!&#8221; echoed
the sad thoughts all day long and into the
still hours of the night.</p>

<p>In the corner of the room sat a little
child, playing with a doll, made of an old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
apron; yet, to the child it was &#8220;the pretty
Dolladine.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was very beautiful, with silken
white hair, shimmered over with a golden
luster. A little garden flower, thrown out
by chance upon the common wayside, yet
blossoming in her own sweet beauty, in
contrast with every thing around her.</p>

<p>She was a real princess born, and her
coarse, ragged clothes could make no difference.</p>

<p>The work was finished, and, though it
was raining still, the mother put on her
worn bonnet to take it home.</p>

<p>&#8220;If the sun would only shine again,&#8221;
she sighed heavily, looking down into the
dismal back alley; &#8220;but I must go.&#8221;</p>

<p>She kissed the child, saying, &#8220;Be
good, darling&mdash;mamma will not be gone
long.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will be good, mamma,&#8221; she answered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
&#8220;and Dolladine and I will catch the sunshine
for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are my only sunshine now,&#8221; said the
mother, hastening away to conceal the tears
that would not stay in their hiding-place.</p>

<p>Then the little one was left alone in the
attic-room, and began, as she often did, to
talk to her doll.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Dolladine,&#8221; she said, &#8220;mamma is
very sad, and sick, I fear, and you and I
must make sunshine for her; but how shall
we do it? that is the question.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you remember, Dolladine, one
day the pretty lady said my hair was
beaming sunshine? We must shake it out
for poor mamma&mdash;we must shake it out;&#8221;
and the little girl began jumping around
the room, shaking her curls, and singing:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;We will make the bright sunshine,</div>
<div class="indent2">Dolladine, Dolladine;</div>
<div class="verse">Make for mamma glad sunshine,</div>
<div class="indent2">Dolladine, Dolladine.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>Just then she saw the sunbeams dancing
into the room. The rain was over, and,
on the roof of the next house, a washerwoman
was hanging out her clothes, which
were blowing about in the wind, casting
gleams of light and shadow upon the little
attic window, so that the sunshine went
flitting about like the will-o&#8217;-the-wisp, for
the shadow was always chasing it.</p>

<p>The child was delighted. &#8220;Do you see
it, Dolladine,&#8221; she said&mdash;&#8220;the glorious sunshine
which the loving God gives us? Now,
we must catch it for mamma.&#8221;</p>

<p>She took the doll in her arms, and gave
chase to the dancing phantom. But it was
no use; just as her little hand was ready
to grasp it, it flew away.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t help me enough, Dolladine,&#8221;
said the child, her little eyes filling with
tears.</p>

<p>Just then, a great double-knock came at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
the door, and, before she could answer it,
in walked a little old man, with a very
wrinkled face and long white beard; a big
hat almost covered his face, so that the
upper part was all in shadow.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you doing, little chick?&#8221;
he said, pleasantly; &#8220;and where is the
mother?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mamma has gone to carry home the
work,&#8221; answered the child, timidly; &#8220;and
Dolladine and I have been making sunshine
for her. But, see! it flies away!&#8221; and
again she tried to catch the dancing beams.</p>

<p>&#8220;It often does from older and wiser
hands than yours; but how did you make
it, fairy?&#8221; asked the old man, laughing.</p>

<p>&#8220;God put it in my hair, and I shook it
out for dear mamma, who is sick, and so
tired of the dark days,&#8221; replied the little
one, again shaking her pretty curls, that
were luminous with beauty.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>&#8220;I see!&#8221; said the old man. &#8220;Now, I am
a great magician, and can help you;&#8221; and
he sang, with a clear, ringing voice:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;Sunshine, sunshine, flitting and airy,</div>
<div class="verse">Dwell in the heart of the little fairy;</div>
<div class="verse">Make her gentle, loving, and mild,</div>
<div class="verse">Make her the mother&#8217;s sunshine child.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>Just at that moment the washerwoman
took down a big sheet, and the little room
was flooded with warm, glowing sunshine.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! it is glorious, is it not, Dolladine?&#8221;
exclaimed the child, clapping her
hands, and dancing about with pleasure.
&#8220;Mamma will be so happy, and so will
Dolladine and I.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Remember,&#8221; said the old magician,
&#8220;that all good comes from the loving God,
who has blessed you, and made you the
sunshine child. You can make the mother
and every one very happy, so long as you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
keep God&#8217;s sunshine in your heart; but if
you forget the blessed Christ, it will fly
away, and will not be the warm, beautiful
light of God&#8217;s love, but only the dancing
sunshine that always escapes your grasp.
And then, how sad! you would change
to the little stormy-weather child, which
would be worse than the darkest winter&#8217;s
day to the dear mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! no, no! I will never forget to
bless the good God. It is so delightful to
make mamma and every one happy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This box,&#8221; said the old man, &#8220;is full
of sunshine; I will give it you for the
mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me kiss you, dear magician,&#8221; said
the child, gently; &#8220;I always love anybody
who is kind to poor mamma.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old man took the little one in
his arms, and kissed her fondly, saying,
&#8220;God bless you, darling; God bless you!&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
Then he went away, to be her life-long
friend.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am so happy, I can not keep still,
Dolladine,&#8221; said the child; and she danced
about till the mother came in, weary and
worn. &#8220;Oh! mamma,&#8221; said she, running
up and kissing her, &#8220;we shall always be
happy now, in God&#8217;s glorious sunshine,
and the old magician gave me this box,
full of it, for you, mamma.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was some time before the mother
could understand all; but when she opened
the box, sure enough, it was full of
sunshine. There was the missing deed,
that restored to her her own&mdash;the dear old
home, and all her great wealth.</p>

<p>Again she became the fair lady with the
lily-white hands; but her greatest joy was
in the warm, genial sunshine her good
little daughter made. From a child she
grew up to be a loving, beautiful, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
pure woman. But she never forgot the
good God, and, all her life, remained the
mother&#8217;s sunshine child.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE YOUNG GOLD-SEEKER.</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the olden time, between the Mission
of San Gabriel and Los Angeles, lived an
old Spaniard, his wife, and one son.</p>

<p>In his early manhood, Don Pedro had
been very rich, but sickness and misfortune
had followed him, until, in his old age, he
was destitute of many of the comforts of
life.</p>

<p>Sorrowful and dispirited, he looked forward
to death as the only portal of hope
for future repose.</p>

<p>Francisco, his son, was full of youthful
ambition and ardent life.</p>

<p>One morning he went to the bedside of
his father and mother, and kneeling down
beside them begged their blessing.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>&#8220;I am going,&#8221; he said, &#8220;dear father and
mother, to retrieve your fallen fortunes.&#8221;</p>

<p>The father blessed him, and bade him
Godspeed, but the mother wept and
clasped her arms about him, till her silver
hair mingled with the glossy black of his;
and when he tore himself regretfully from
her embrace, she called him again and
again to return for one more kiss. At last,
when he rushed out, and was nearly gone
from her, she buried her head in the bed-clothes
and sobbed as if her heart would
break.</p>

<p>Francisco was at first greatly saddened
and subdued by his dear mother&#8217;s grief; but
soon with the fresh morning air, the elastic
spirits of youth, rose joyous and hopeful,
and he sung merrily as he wandered on
through the open country.</p>

<p>He had taken with him some tortillas
(coarse Indian-meal cakes) and dried beef.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>When he was hungry, he sat down in the
shade, ate sparingly of these and of the delicious
fruits that abound through all the
country, and drank from the clear spring.</p>

<p>Thus passed the first few days of his
journeying; but there came a time, when,
out in the desert, his food became exhausted,
and there were no cooling springs bubbling
up from the yellow heat of the burning
sand.</p>

<p>There were no trees, no fruit, no shade.
He wandered on for two days and nights,
until nature was almost exhausted, and
when the third night came, he threw himself
upon the sand to die.</p>

<p>He prayed devoutly to the Holy Virgin
to intercede for his soul, and grant his
fevered body rest; when, as he turned his
head wearily, far out on the desert gleamed
a light.</p>

<p>Hope rose in his bosom, and he drew his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
aching limbs onward, till nearer and nearer
gleamed the blessed light from a cool oasis
in the desert. Soon his foot pressed the
soft turf, and green trees waved above his
head.</p>

<p>The blessed Virgin had pitied him and
listened to his prayer. He was saved.</p>

<p>He thought the waters of the running
stream the sweetest music he had ever
beard, and bending over, with his hand he
raised to his parched lips a draught of holy
water&mdash;for &#8217;twas the Mother of Mercy&#8217;s
gift&mdash;the gift of life.</p>

<p>Extreme thirst is the most intolerable
of all sufferings&mdash;greater far than hunger.
None but those who have endured its
pangs, can have the least idea of the excruciating
pain it brings.</p>

<p>After Francisco had drank the water, he
was for a time very sick, but soon was
sufficiently relieved to long for food and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
rest, so again he looked for the light that
had guided him to the oasis.</p>

<p>Just before him, from the thicket of palm-trees
it gleamed. He drew near cautiously,
fearing it might prove the encampment of
hostile Indians.</p>

<p>Softly as he stepped, the quick ear of an
old Indian woman detected his approach,
and she raised her eyes to meet his eager
and hungry gaze, as he looked longingly at
the supper she was preparing over the fire
just outside her little cane hut.</p>

<p>When he saw that he was discovered, he
went up to her, holding out his hand, and
saying:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good mother, I am very hungry and
weary, give me something to eat and let me
rest here to-night, or I shall die. Oh,
mother! mother!&#8221;</p>

<p>He was thinking of his own mother at
home; but his words and tones sunk into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
the heart of the old Indian woman, and
tears gathered in her dim eyes as she
placed her hand softly on Francisco&#8217;s
shoulders.</p>

<p>&#8220;You call me mother,&#8221; she said, in
Spanish, sadly, &#8220;those who used to call me
mother are all dead! My boy would have
been like you. My brave boy! my timid
girl, gone! all gone!&#8221;</p>

<p>She wept bitterly as she gave Francisco
the choicest morsels, and a cool, delicious
drink, that was a balm to his parched and
aching throat.</p>

<p>When Francisco had eaten, he was overcome
with fatigue and want of sleep, but
when he would have thrown himself down
upon a mat in the hut, and fallen asleep
immediately, the old mother caught him by
the arm, exclaiming:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;You must not lie down there to sleep,
you would never wake again; for when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
chief, my husband, returns, he would kill
you, for he hates the Spaniards. What can
I do with you, my poor boy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can go no farther, mother, I shall die
of fatigue if I try; think of the two days
and nights I passed upon the desert, without
food, drink or sleep.&#8221; And he threw
himself in the corner, saying: &#8220;he must kill
me if he will,&#8221; and in a moment was fast
asleep.</p>

<p>The old woman bent over and kissed
him, weeping.</p>

<p>&#8220;He called me mother,&#8221; she said, &#8220;poor
boy, poor boy.&#8221;</p>

<p>She covered him over with cool boughs,
with the thick green leaves still fresh upon
them.</p>

<p>How long he slept he could not tell, but
while it was yet dark, a rough voice very
near, awoke him.</p>

<p>Opening his eyes and peering through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
the mass of foliage, he saw a gigantic Indian,
surrounded by half a dozen younger
men, all eating what appeared to be an
early breakfast, and talking over some adventure
in which they were about engaging.</p>

<p>From their conversation he learned that
he was approaching the borders of the rich
Arizona country; and he noticed, when
the chief put up his ammunition (he was
the only one who carried a gun), that the
bullet was of pure gold.</p>

<p>He lay for some time motionless, carefully
watching their movements. At one
time he came very near being discovered.</p>

<p>One of the young Indians had mislaid
his bow and arrow, and went to the pile of
brush to look for it; but the old woman,
whose mother&#8217;s heart had warmed to the
perishing young stranger, drove the Indian
boy away, with a sharp reproof for his
carelessness in disturbing her basket of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
reeds, which were mingled with the concealing
boughs.</p>

<p>At last the missing bow was found, and
the company mounted and rode away.</p>

<p>Again silence fell upon the palm-shaded
hut.</p>

<p>Still weary, Francisco lay quietly watching
the old woman, as she moved about
with a lighted taper, silently putting the
things to rights; but at last she blew out
the light, and lay down to rest upon a mat
near the door, and in the darkness, the
green oasis of the desert faded into the
land of dreams.</p>

<p>The morning sun was shining clear and
bright, through the waving branches of the
palm-trees, when Francisco again awoke.</p>

<p>There was no one in the hut when he
arose and went to the spring, where the
night before he had slaked his thirst.</p>

<p>Again he drank from its pure fountain,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
bathing his face and neck in the sparkling
water, till he felt quite refreshed.</p>

<p>Above his head, amid the glossy leaves
hung the rich yellow bananas.</p>

<p>He gathered some and ate them as he
returned to the hut, with a hopeful, happy
heart.</p>

<p>The old mother met him at the door, and
greeted him pleasantly.</p>

<p>They sat down together and ate their
morning meal. Francisco told her how he
had left home to seek his fortune, and of
his father and mother, who had once been
very rich, and had become poor, and in
their old age were suffering for the comforts
of life. How he had vowed, if his life was
spared, that they should enjoy all that
money and love could provide for them.
&#8220;And now, mother,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I am seeking
gold, and gold I must have, if my life pays
the forfeit.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>&#8220;Were it not that the chieftain, my husband,
would kill you, I could show you
where gold is plenty enough,&#8221; said the old
woman. &#8220;Only one day&#8217;s journey from
here are the great mines, and even on the
ground you can pick up quite large nuggets
of almost pure gold; but every hour you
stay here your life is in danger, and you
must live to be happy.</p>

<p>&#8220;There are places in the Arizona country
where the ground is yellow with gold.
The Indians care little for it, but you
could never go there and return alive. At
every step your way would be beset with
a more deadly foe than the hunger and
thirst of the desert.</p>

<p>&#8220;Boy, you have wakened a love that was
dead in my heart. I will save you if
possible, and, as nearly as I can will grant
your wishes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the old woman prepared food and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
water for a journey, and taking two deer-skin
bags, she filled them with great nuggets
of pure gold, and laid across the back
of a strong mule, as much as he could carry,
and embracing Francisco, she bade him take
the mule and recross the desert with all
possible dispatch.</p>

<p>&#8220;To-night our men will return, and you
must be far away.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then she gave him directions about the
way. &#8220;By to-night, if you keep the trail,
you will reach green trees and water. Go
home now, be rich and happy; but some
times remember the lonely Indian mother
far away in Arizona.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old woman embraced him again,
weeping, and said: &#8220;All who call me
mother must go from me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Francisco kissed her brown cheek, and
went out from under the shade of the palm-trees
into the arid waste.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>Looking back, as long as he could see
over the desert, in the distance he saw the
old woman watching him. She, too, had
gone out from the shadow of the palm-trees,
and stood upon the burning sand,
shading her tearful eyes with her wrinkled
hand from the blinding sunshine.</p>

<p>God pity the childless mother.</p>

<p>Francisco was fortunate in keeping the
trail, and at night reached the trees and
water the old woman had spoken of, but
the desert was still before him&mdash;a long and
toilsome journey.</p>

<p>For six weary days he traveled through
an arid sandy waste, finding water at intervals;
and when at last the green hills of
San Gabriel rose before him, he wept like
a child for joy; but he soon called back
his manhood and laughed at his weakness.</p>

<p>With a full happy heart he journeyed
on, till Los Angeles, dear Los Angeles, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
home of his infancy, lay before him. There
was the cottage of his mother, and she herself
standing at the door. He had returned
after all his hardships, strong, rich, and
happy. Again the gray hair of his mother
rested on his shoulder, but this time she
wept tears of joy, as he whispered in her
ear: &#8220;Mother, dear! you and father can
never want again, I am rich now. I have
gold enough to last a lifetime; and, mother,
you shall have a beautiful home: and I
will ask Juanita, who loves you, to come
and be your daughter and my wife.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE WISHING-CAP.</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Through</span> the branches of a great almond-tree
sported the golden sunlight, till it fell
in shining flecks upon the broad verandas
of a spacious adobe house. Nothing could
be pleasanter than this homestead in the
southern Gold Land, with the great garden
around it, filled with all kinds of tropical
flowers and fruits in their season. Here
dwelt a little boy and girl, whose father
and mother were both dead, so they, poor
children, had their sorrows.</p>

<p>After the mother died, the father had
married a poor widow, who had two children,
about the age of his own little ones.</p>

<p>At first, while the comfort of the new
home was a novelty to the woman, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
had been kind to the children; but, as the
strangeness wore off, she began to feel like
the real mistress. In a thousand ways she
favored her own children, who were proud
and selfish; and in all their childish differences,
only the motherless ones were
punished.</p>

<p>Then the father died, and the step-mother
became like a great shadow between
them and the bright sunshine of
childhood. She would have sent them
away from home, but their own mother
had been very rich, and, after the father&#8217;s
death, the house in which they lived, the
vineyard, and the large herd of cattle feeding
upon the hills, all belonged to them.</p>

<p>The step-mother was very angry at this,
but she was their guardian, so she managed
every thing to suit herself, and lived in
great ease and luxury.</p>

<p>One day, as the children were playing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
in the garden, the step-mother&#8217;s son threw
his ball into a wild-rosebush that was covered
with thorns.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go and get it for me, Zoie,&#8221; said he,
sharply, to the little girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can not,&#8221; replied the child, &#8220;for the
thorns will tear my dress, and the señora
will whip me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How dare you call my mother the
señora? It is not from respect, but because
you are a hateful little beast.&#8221; And he
struck the child a cruel blow, and made
her go for the ball.</p>

<p>Her dress was torn, and her pretty hands
bleeding when she recovered it. Just then
her own brother came up, and would have
fought the unkind boy, but the little Zoie
entreated, weeping, &#8220;Dear brother, do not
strike him. Come with me, while I say,
&#8216;Forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive
those who trespass against us.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>The heart of the young boy swelled
with anger, and his quickened pulse beat
fearfully; but, because he loved his sister,
he suffered her to lead him away, for well
he knew, nothing would grieve her so
much as his returning blow for blow.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! to be a man!&#8221; he thought, as the
hot tears filled his eyes. &#8220;Why don&#8217;t the
years fly fast? How long must I wait, before
I can take care of my little sister like
a man?&#8221;</p>

<p>Already the manhood was dawning in
his heart; and if he could have protected
the dear little maiden, he would have
dared any thing.</p>

<p>At this moment the garden gate opened,
and an old Indian woman came up the
walk, crying&mdash;&#8220;Strawberries! fresh and
ripe, red and bright. Strawberries! strawberries!&#8221;</p>

<p>All the children ran to meet her, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
looked so eagerly at the pretty crimson
fruit, that she gave to each of them a
handful, but to the little sister, who was
so modest and beautiful, she gave a small
basket, covered with green leaves, and filled
with the delicious berries.</p>

<p>When the other children would have
taken the basket for themselves, the old
woman prevented them; and, while they
went, crying, to their mother, Zoie hid her
treasure under the trailing vines of a passion-flower.</p>

<p>&#8220;Be quick, little señorita,&#8221; said the old
Indian. &#8220;Your mother once saved the life
of my child, and an Indian never forgets.
In the basket is a wonderful talisman,
which will give you any thing you want,
just for the wishing.&#8221;</p>

<p>She had hardly time to say this, when
the step-mother came out, and bought all
the fruit she had left.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>The señora was very angry with the
orphans, and, after whipping them both
for quarreling, sent them supperless to
bed, in an old out-house where the Indian
servants slept, but she and her children
sat down to a luxurious meal, with a large
basket of delicious strawberries in the center
of the table, plenty of nice white sugar,
and three bowls of fresh, rich cream.</p>

<p>For some time the lonely orphans lay
talking of their own dear parents, and
weeping, as they lay shivering in each
other&#8217;s arms. The evening was coming on,
and, though the days were very warm,
there was a chill in the damp night air,
and they had only a thin sheet to cover
them.</p>

<p>At last the brother said: &#8220;Sister, I can
not endure it. If they would only whip
me&mdash;but to see them strike you! I can not
endure it! You, whom I promised the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
dear papa to love and protect. We have
nothing but sorrow here. Let us go out
into the wide world alone. It will not be
so bad&mdash;at least we shall be away from
the señora, who gives only hard crusts
to eat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear brother, let us go! The good
God, who takes care of the pretty birds,
will take care of us. But first bring me
my blue shawl, for it was the last thing
the dear mamma gave me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Very softly the boy rose and went for
the shawl, but the old Indian cook, who
had lived in the family before he was
born, and loved the children dearly, saw
him and gave him some tortillas.</p>

<p>&#8220;The old wizzen witch, to treat the real
señora&#8217;s children so!&#8221; said the woman, angrily.
&#8220;She, the señora, to be sure! A
cane hut in the chaparral would be good
enough for her.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>&#8220;Good-bye, mammie,&#8221; said the boy, throwing
his arms around the old Indian&#8217;s neck;
&#8220;we are going away to seek our fortune,
and when I am a man, you shall live with
us. But do not follow us now, or she will
see you. We are running away from the
señora,&#8221; he whispered softly.</p>

<p>The old Indian pressed him to her heart
for a moment, and then said, &#8220;Go! for
nothing in the wild woods will hurt you
so much as staying here. I shall go to-morrow,
but I must wait and see that the
old witch does not bring you back, for I
believe she would kill you, only for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the boy went softly out, and the
old Indian covered her face with her apron,
and thought over her half savage thoughts,
which were still full of good faith and love
to the children who had slept in her bosom
in their helpless infancy.</p>

<p>The little Zoie was waiting for her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
brother in the garden. As soon as she
saw him, she held up the basket of strawberries,
saying, &#8220;This is all we have, but,
no doubt in the wide world, God will give
us all we need.&#8221;</p>

<p>The young boy wrapped the shawl about
her, and, clasping each other&#8217;s hands, they
stole out of the garden silently, but, when
the gate had closed upon them, he told her
how the old cook had given them the
tortillas.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is but the beginning of our good
fortune,&#8221; answered the child.</p>

<p>As they passed the Lake of the Tuleis,
the moon and stars were shining pleasantly,
casting a flood of soft golden light
upon the graves of the father and mother.
Here the children stopped for a moment,
and the little maiden laid her head upon
the green grave of the mother, crying&mdash;&#8220;Oh,
mamma, mamma! We loved you so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
dearly, and are so lonely now. We are
going out into the wide world alone,
mamma! dear, sweet mamma!&#8221;</p>

<p>She buried her head in the long grass,
and there would have wept herself to
sleep, as she had often done before, but
the brother took her by the hand, saying,
&#8220;We must hasten, sister, or the señora
will come after us.&#8221;</p>

<p>So they ran on as fast as they could,
and every waving shrub or tree their fear
and the darkness changed into the form
of the angry step-mother.</p>

<p>At last they came to a thick wood, and
began to feel quite safe as they entered it.
It seemed so large, and so far out into the
wide world, that they were sure the step-mother
could never find them there.</p>

<p>The gray twilight of the morning was
coming on, and, as they were very tired
and hungry, they sat down under the trees<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
to eat their tortillas and strawberries. In
the bottom of the basket Zoie found a nut,
about the size of an almond. &#8220;This must
be the talisman that makes wishing &#8216;having,&#8217;&#8221;
said the little girl.</p>

<p>They wished all sorts of things, but
nothing came to them, and the boy said,
&#8220;It is a poor talisman&mdash;throw it away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, brother,&#8221; answered the child; &#8220;the
old woman was so kind to me, for her sake
I will keep it always, and who knows
what may come of it yet?&#8221;</p>

<p>So she wrapped it in a leaf, and placed
it in her bosom. Then they said their
prayers, and, covering themselves with the
shawl, they slept soundly till morning.</p>

<p>When they awoke, the sun was shining
through the leaves of a rich banana tree,
and the ripe golden fruit was hanging in
thick bunches just above their heads.</p>

<p>&#8220;See, brother,&#8221; said the little girl, &#8220;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
good God has given us our breakfast;&#8221;
and they gathered from the ground as
much of the delicious fruit as they
wished.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am so thirsty,&#8221; said the brother.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hear something that sounds like running
water,&#8221; replied Zoie.</p>

<p>So they looked around, until they found
a brook, with a clear spring of water bubbling
up in the midst of the shining
stones.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thank the good God for this pure,
clear water,&#8221; said the little girl, drinking
with much pleasure, for she, too, was beginning
to be very thirsty.</p>

<p>&#8220;We must go now,&#8221; said the boy.</p>

<p>They each took as many bananas as
they could carry, and started to go, they
knew not whither.</p>

<p>They were light-hearted and happy in
all their morning wanderings, but by noon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
they began to feel tired, hungry, and
thirsty.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sorry we left the beautiful shady
banana tree and the brook. It is so hot,
and I am very thirsty,&#8221; said the boy,
sadly. So they both looked for water, but
could find none.</p>

<p>&#8220;God will give us some by and by,&#8221;
said the little sister. &#8220;Let us sit down
and eat our dinner.&#8221;</p>

<p>They ate their bananas with sad hearts,
and the wide world seemed very desolate.
All around them the grass was withered,
and the trees and shrubs were dying for
want of water.</p>

<p>Though they were so much fatigued, and
it was very warm, they were too thirsty to
think of rest, and all the afternoon they
wandered about looking for water and
finding none.</p>

<p>By and by the twilight came on, then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
the stars and the great golden moon shone
upon the pale face of the children, glistening
with tears.</p>

<p>&#8220;What shall we do, sister,&#8221; said the
boy, weeping, and falling upon the ground
in despair; &#8220;we shall die, we can not be
buried by the Lake of the Tuleis, with the
dear papa and mamma.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do not cry, brother,&#8221; said the little Zoie,
her own eyes filling with tears. &#8220;I am
sure God will help us, and if he lets us die
here, he will send the birds to cover us
with leaves, as they did the poor little &#8216;children
in the woods.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>She put her arms around her brother&#8217;s
neck, and kissed him, saying again, &#8220;Do
not cry, dear, God <i>will</i> help us, he is our
&#8216;Father who art in heaven.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>So they started again, and very soon
they saw a tiny light shining through the
trees, and as they ran forward it grew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
brighter, and clearer, and they heard a
very pleasant sound, the rushing of waters.</p>

<p>Taking heart again, they urged their
little weary feet forward, till they came to
a mill, and the clear light shone from the
comfortable room, in which sat the weary
miller, by a glowing fire, while his young
son prepared the supper.</p>

<p>They knocked timidly at the door, and
a rough kind voice said, &#8220;Come in.&#8221;</p>

<p>They entered, and saw the miller sitting
by the fire, and his handsome young son
spreading the table.</p>

<p>The old man spoke to them, but they
could not understand him, for he spoke in
English, and they were Spanish children;
but the boy said, in the soft Spanish tongue,
&#8220;My friends, who are you? and where did
you come from?&#8221;</p>

<p>The little girl answered, &#8220;We are poor
children, whose papa and mamma are dead,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
and God takes care of us. We are very
hungry and thirsty, and he showed us the
light shining from your window, so we are
here!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the boy gave them milk to drink,
and put two more plates on the table, while
he told the father what the children said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bless her innocent heart,&#8221; said the old
man, &#8220;God&#8217;s little ones are welcome.&#8221;</p>

<p>He took the child in his arms, and she
nestled her head down in his rough neck,
and whispered, &#8220;I love you, you seem like
the dear papa.&#8221;</p>

<p>A tear came into the old man&#8217;s eye, he
only understood the word papa, but there
was affection in the little arms that twined
around his neck, and he kissed her, and
said again, &#8220;Bless her little heart.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her winning ways touched his affectionate
nature, they made him think of a
lonely grave, and his own lost darling.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>Meanwhile the boys talked pleasantly
till supper was ready, then they sat down
together to a bountiful table, and the
hungry children ate heartily, and drank
the pure sweet milk, which after their long
thirst seemed delicious.</p>

<p>After supper they went to sleep on a
nice deer-skin, spread upon the floor, but
some how that night the old man could
not sleep.</p>

<p>He got up two or three times to look at the
children, with the tears standing in his eyes.</p>

<p>He was living over the past. &#8220;Bless
her little heart,&#8221; he said, smoothing with
his rough hand the soft wavy hair of the
little girl.</p>

<p>In the morning the children woke much
refreshed. At first they did not know
where they were, but they saw the face of
the old man turned kindly toward them,
and remembered all.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>At breakfast the brother told their story
to the boy, and he interpreted it to the
father.</p>

<p>&#8220;They shall stay with us,&#8221; said the old
man, with great satisfaction, for he had
dreaded parting with the child that had
so won his love.</p>

<p>After breakfast they went into the mill,
and the handsome boy told the orphans
his story, in return.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some years ago,&#8221; he said, &#8220;my father
and mother came to this country, bringing
my little sister and myself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother and sister died very soon after
we arrived, and father and I have lived
here alone for many years.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t tell how lonely it was at
first,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;and how I used to
cry myself to sleep, and poor father was
very sad. I am so glad you are going to
stay with us.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>&#8220;God sent us,&#8221; said the little girl, smiling.
And the children were very contented
and happy together.</p>

<p>Thus they lived for many years at the
old mill.</p>

<p>The little Zoie grew to be a beautiful
maiden, as good as fair.</p>

<p>To the old father she was a great blessing,
making his home always neat and
pleasant.</p>

<p>The two boys were handsome, strong
young men, full of energy and life. Every
day they roamed over the mountains, prospecting
for gold. The old mill was falling
to decay, and promised but little in the
future.</p>

<p>One evening, when they had returned
after a hard day&#8217;s work, weary and out of
heart, they sat down on the stone steps of
the old mill to rest themselves. The waters
were flowing on with their usual pleasant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
music, and they were thinking and
hoping for the future. When the household
work was done Zoie came out and sat
by them. To amuse them she told over
the old story of the strawberries and
the talisman that should make &#8220;wishing
having.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me see the nut,&#8221; said the miller&#8217;s
son, and Zoie gave it to him.</p>

<p>Placing it upon the stone door-step, he
pressed his heel upon it, and the shell
burst open, showing a silken cap of bright
crimson, trimmed with cord, and tassel of
gold.</p>

<p>They were all greatly surprised, and
the miller&#8217;s son placed it upon Zoie&#8217;s shining
hair.</p>

<p>&#8220;How pretty it is,&#8221; said she. &#8220;I wish I
had a rose-bush filled with roses of the
same color.&#8221;</p>

<p>She had hardly spoken, before a rose-bush,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
covered with beautiful crimson flowers,
sprang up at their feet.</p>

<p>Then they knew that the pretty silken
toy was a wonderful wishing-cap, and that
any thing they might desire, could be had
for the wishing.</p>

<p>In the morning, when the young men
went out, Zoie put on the cap, and wished
they might find a mine of great richness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Though we could now live without the
trouble of working,&#8221; she said to the father,
&#8220;a rich mine would help hundreds of poor
people, who would find employment in it.
So it would be a real blessing.&#8221;</p>

<p>While they sat talking, the brother
rushed in, bringing a great nugget of gold,
telling how at last, they had found a mine
of fabulous richness.</p>

<p>Thus, they had every thing they desired,
till one day, the miller&#8217;s son put on the
cap, and told Zoie, that above every thing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
in the world, he wished that she might
love him, and consent to be his wife.</p>

<p>The young maiden blushed, and begged
for the cap. &#8220;It was not quite fair,&#8221; she said,
&#8220;in wishing that!&#8221; So they talked, as
young people will, but it ended in her
placing her hand in his, and promising to
be his bride.</p>

<p>&#8220;And this,&#8221; as the father said, &#8220;was the
best wish of all.&#8221;</p>

<p>The brother was greatly pleased, and
said, &#8220;Zoie shall be married in the old
home.&#8221; So they all went together to the
pleasant adobe house from which they had
fled so long ago.</p>

<p>The step-mother was greatly surprised
so see them. She had so often reported
them dead, that she really began to believe
it herself.</p>

<p>She was obliged to give up everything
to the true heirs. Thus she and her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
children became very poor again. Though
the brothers and sisters gave her a comfortable
house, and provided for her, she was
very ungrateful.</p>

<p>She was a disappointed woman, unhappy
herself and making others so around her.</p>

<p>It was a glorious day when the young
people were married, and Zoie in her snow-white
robes and rich lace veil, was as fair
a bride as the sun could shine upon.</p>

<p>All the old friends of the family were invited
to the wedding feast, and the old
servants taken home again.</p>

<p>Every one was rejoiced to see the orphans
enjoying their own&mdash;but of them all&mdash;no
one was so happy as the old miller, and
when he kissed the bride after the ceremony,
he whispered, &#8220;bless your little heart,
I could not live without my child.&#8221; The
young bride looked into his face, with beaming
eyes, and answered only &#8220;my father.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>Thus they were all happy, and, through
the changing scenes of life, the goodness
and faith of the wife and mother, never
failed. Like the little maid, Zoie, in the
dark night, she trusted, and God always
took care of them.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CRIMSON TUFT.</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the early days, many strange things
happened. It was the mystical age of
romance in the Gold Land, and people
seemed to live years in months, or even
weeks. Thus a great deal has been forgotten.</p>

<p>In the old countries it was not so, and it
may be that some are living even now at
&#8220;dear Bingen on the Rhine,&#8221; who remember
tenderly the handsome young couple
who left their home to seek the alluring
treasures of the Gold Land in &#8220;the early
days.&#8221;</p>

<p>They were honest peasants in the Father
land, but over the waters had floated the
marvelous story, how, in the glorious El<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
Dorado, any one might become a lord of the
soil or a rich miner prince.</p>

<p>This it was that fired the heart of the
father; and as the mother looked upon
their boy, she too was ready to go out into
the great world, though her heart lay fondly
to the beloved Fatherland.</p>

<p>They had little money, but the thrifty
good-man managed to work for one and
another on the passage, till, when he arrived
at the young city of tents within the Golden
Gate, he had cash enough to make a beginning
in life.</p>

<p>They were soon domesticated in a little
shanty, and in a short time had prepared a
fine garden, which became the good-man&#8217;s
pride. Every morning dame Waltenburger
went to the market, where she had a stall,
and sold fruit and vegetables for gold dust,
for that was the currency of the country in
&#8220;the early days.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>The little son was ten years old, and a
real delight to the mother&#8217;s heart.</p>

<p>He was well formed, with fine features,
golden brown hair, and wonderfully expressive
eyes. When he was calm and
happy they were of a soft looming blue, but
if excited or angry, they grew dark and
fierce, flashing like balls of fire.</p>

<p>It pleased him above all things, to assist
the dear mother at the market, and very soon
he displayed great taste in the arrangements
of the fruits and vegetables.</p>

<p>With maternal pride, the mother often
told the neighbors &#8220;it would be impossible
to do without Paul,&#8221; for really he was the
greatest help to her.</p>

<p>When the flowers were in blossom, the
boy always made them into bouquets and
garlands, while his pretty ways brought
many a purchaser.</p>

<p>Sometimes he used to carry home parcels<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
for ladies who had made large purchases,
and very often he received presents from
them. With the regular customers the
handsome little fellow was a great favorite.</p>

<p>One day, as Paul and the mother sat in
the stall together, talking of the dear Fatherland
so far away, they saw a very queer-looking
Spanish woman approaching. She
seemed bowed down with age and infirmities,
and leaned heavily upon her staff as she
hobbled along with the greatest difficulty.</p>

<p>After the Spanish fashion her head was
covered with a shawl, from which peered
her thin sharp face, quite furrowed with
wrinkles. Her bleared eyes were red, and
her long hooked nose nearly met her pointed
chin. Altogether she was very unpleasant
in her appearance.</p>

<p>All the time she kept her toothless mouth
moving as she mumbled indistinctly to herself.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>She came directly up to dame Waltenburger&#8217;s
stall, and entering it, threw herself
down upon the bench, exclaiming:
&#8220;This is what comes of growing old, nothing
but weariness, care, and aching of bones,&#8221;
and she began rubbing her knees and
muttering to herself.</p>

<p>Little Paul stood looking at her, his eyes
dilated with wonder, and the compassion
of his heart made them blue as the cloudless
sky.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; exclaimed the old woman, looking
into his innocent face with a hideous
grimace, &#8220;what are you staring at, with
your great round owl-eyes? Do you think it
is a fine thing to be old, and lame, and poor?
You will have to come to it. Ah! yes, there
is a comfort in that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Old Father Time will take care of you.
Yes! yes! yes!&#8221; And she shook her long
bony fingers, and chuckled in such a horrible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
way, that the child retreated behind the
mother&#8217;s chair, and hid his face upon her
protecting shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go quickly, boy, and bring me some
fresh water,&#8221; said the old woman, &#8220;I am
very thirsty,&#8221; she added, looking at the
mother.</p>

<p>Little Paul took a glass and ran away to
the well and drew a bucket of water, so
clear and sparkling that it glistened in the
sunlight like the dew of the morning.</p>

<p>As he carried it along, he thought how
the professor had told him of shining nectar
that Hebe used to bear in the golden cup
to Jupiter and all the gods of Olympus.</p>

<p>&#8220;That was in the olden time,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;but no nectar could be more beautiful and
pure than the water the loving God in
heaven gives to us all.&#8221;</p>

<p>Offering it to the old woman, his open
rosy face beaming with smiles, he said &#8220;it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
is nectar fit for the gods, and I am your cup-bearer.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he bowed so prettily that the
mother laughed, saying, &#8220;did one ever see
such a child? oh! you mischief,&#8221; and she
shook her fingers in the cunning old way
that all mothers do.</p>

<p>The old woman took the glass, but
managed to spill half its contents over the
child&#8217;s clean clothes, then she chuckled with
delight at his discomfiture, saying &#8220;see
what it is to be old, my little cup-bearer.&#8221;</p>

<p>While the mother wiped off the water
with her handkerchief the woman began
picking over the vegetables and fruit with
her thin hooked fingers, and smelling every
bouquet of flowers, till little Paul&#8217;s eyes
grew dark and flashed like living flames.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just see her, mother,&#8221; he whispered,
&#8220;who will buy them after she has handled
every thing with her dirty hands, and snuffed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
all the sweetness and beauty out of the
flowers with her ugly, crooked nose?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you little viper,&#8221; cried the old
woman, springing forward, &#8220;I&#8217;ll teach you
to mock at old age.&#8221;</p>

<p>Paul was too quick for her, and had it
not been for the mother she would have
fallen, in her eagerness to catch him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind the child, my good woman,&#8221;
said dame Waltenburger, gently, &#8220;we were
all children once, now how can I serve you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To be sure! we were all children once.
Ah! me!</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no! I don&#8217;t mind the child, my little
cup-bearer,&#8221; and the old woman drew her
wizen face into a hundred wrinkles, and
began selecting a large quantity of fruits,
vegetables and herbs, far more than she
could carry.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it far you have to go?&#8221; said the
mother.</p>



<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_160f.jpg" alt="Crimson Tuft" /></div>
<p class="caption"><i>Crimson Tuft.</i></p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>&#8220;No, no! not far,&#8221; replied the woman.</p>

<p>So the mother called Paul to help her.
He was very reluctant to go; but, when
the mother kissed him, and promised to
make him a beautiful ball, and cover it
with red morocco, he came forward and
took the basket readily.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I,&#8221; said the old woman, &#8220;will give
him a beautiful crimson tuft; he will be
gay as a lark, my little cup-bearer.&#8221;</p>

<p>This seemed delightful to Paul, and he
followed after the old woman, thinking&mdash;&#8220;I
can play soldier with the crimson tuft,
and the professor in the next house will
hear me, and call me Charlemagne. It will
be glorious to be the soldier with the crimson
tuft.&#8221;</p>

<p>Little Paul walked on in quite a lordly
way, with his great martial thoughts echoing
in all the chambers of his boyish heart,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
&#8220;It will be glorious&mdash;the soldier of the
crimson tuft!&#8221;</p>

<p>On, on they went, far out into the sand
hills, in an opposite direction from his own
home.</p>

<p>Paul&#8217;s arm began to ache very much,
carrying the heavy basket, but he was
feeling so manly, that he did not like to
complain; but at last he became so tired,
that it was no use&mdash;he could not bear it
any longer, and great tears filled his eyes
and covered his rosy cheeks.</p>

<p>All the way the old woman had been
muttering to herself in Spanish, but Paul
could not understand that.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am so tired,&#8221; he said, resting the
basket upon the ground.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it is not far! not far! and I will
give you the bright crimson tuft&mdash;think
of that,&#8221; replied the old woman.</p>

<p>So Paul took up the basket, and again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
they went on a long, long way, and turned
so many corners, he feared he could never
find his way back, but still the thought of
the crimson tuft allured him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must have it,&#8221; he said; &#8220;that would
be a real pleasure.&#8221;</p>

<p>At last, when he was just ready to fall
down with fatigue, they came to a great
iron-barred gate, and the old woman rung
the bell very loudly.</p>

<p>In a moment a great rough voice called,
in Spanish, as through a trumpet, &#8220;Who
rings at the gate?&#8221;</p>

<p>Very soon the gate was opened by a
curious-looking dwarf, who started and
grinned fearfully when he saw Paul.</p>

<p>The child offered him the basket, but he
only shook his head, pointing after the old
woman, who gave him her staff, and walked
along with as much ease as little Paul
himself.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>Now the child was really frightened,
and would have run away, but he was
already within the gate, and, with a great
clang, it closed. The dwarf put up the
iron bars, and replaced the bolts. Nothing
could be more secure, for all around rose
an immense high fence, topped with sharp
spikes. It was impossible to escape&mdash;no
one could get in or out.</p>

<p>A long avenue led to a pleasant-looking
house, built in the Spanish fashion. It
was shaded with beautiful trees, that had
been brought from the southern country.
How they waved their long fan-like leaves
in the sunshine! It was a picture engraven
upon the child&#8217;s mind never to be
effaced.</p>

<p>Under the shadow of the trees walked
the old woman toward the house, and Paul
followed with the basket, trembling like
the light leaves of the tamarind. Just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
behind him came the dwarf. He could
hear his heavy tread.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is no use! no use!&#8221; thought the
child; but he would gladly have given
the tempting crimson tuft, the red morocco
ball, all, all his pretty treasures, to have
been once more by the mother&#8217;s side, selling
vegetables in the market.</p>

<p>They entered a large, pleasant drawing-room,
with doors opening upon the front
piazza and upon the verandah of the inner
court, so that, though it was very warm, a
delicious breeze swept through the room,
and made it delightfully cool.</p>

<p>The old woman threw herself upon a
couch, and, pointing to a silver bell, told
Paul to ring it, adding, &#8220;My little cup-bearer,
you must be tired, and I will order
something to refresh you before you return
to your good mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not so very tired,&#8221; said Paul;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
&#8220;let me go&mdash;the mother will need me;&#8221;
and he looked imploringly into the pitiless
face that he was beginning to fear above
all things.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ring the bell, boy,&#8221; was the only
answer.</p>

<p>So he rang the bell, and the dwarf,
who had left them on the piazza, entered.</p>

<p>The woman addressed him in Spanish,
which Paul did not understand, but, as he
went to and from a large closet, and began
spreading the table, he would turn his
curious squinting eyes upon the child with
looks of compassion.</p>

<p>In a short time all was ready; and what
a delicious lunch it might have been to
the child, but for the great fear that overshadowed
him! Delicate cakes and confections,
cold chicken, eggs, and all kinds of
fruits that children are so fond of, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
many nice-looking things that Paul had
never seen before.</p>

<p>There was a great pyramid of ice-cream.
&#8220;How I should like to eat it with the dear
mother!&#8221; thought Paul.</p>

<p>Oh! that <i>was</i> a delicious lunch, to be
sure!</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, let us sit down,&#8221; said the old
woman.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not hungry,&#8221; answered Paul, timidly;
for he longed so greatly to be at
home, that even these unaccustomed delicacies,
and the promised crimson tuft, were
as nothing compared with the sweet comfort
at the dear mother&#8217;s side.</p>

<p>&#8220;You silly child! You have walked all
this distance, carrying that great basket,
and are not hungry? Well, you are thirsty,
and for your nectar of the gods, I will return
you the sherbet of an eastern prince.&#8221;</p>

<p>The woman filled a glass with a clear,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
rosy liquid, that bubbled up and sparkled
so temptingly, that little Paul, who was
quite overcome with fatigue and thirst,
grasped it eagerly, and did not take the
glass from his lips till he had drained it to
the bottom.</p>

<p>Then he wished to start for home, but
he felt so drowsy that he could not move.
He thought of the mother, but felt no
emotion, and looked at the hideous old
woman, who was grinning horribly, without
fear. In a few moments he sunk down
upon the couch, in a heavy sleep.</p>

<p>The woman stood over him, chuckling in
great glee. &#8220;I have you now, my pretty
cup-bearer, and will make you of great use
to me. I will teach you a thousand things
you would be glad not to know! You
shall have a crimson tuft, ha! ha! ha!
I will teach you to be impertinent to me!
My hooked nose! to be sure. Ah! I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
old! old! and nothing can make me young
and fair. If I could only take for myself
your young beauty! But, no! one day I
must die, and that will be the end.&#8221;</p>

<p>The woman&#8217;s face grew convulsed&mdash;for
she was haunted by the grim specter, Death,
as with a dread terror. Her life had
been so filled with darkness, that she could
not look forward to the calm hereafter.
All the brightness and beauty of heaven,
the golden, was like the fleeting dreams
of childhood, that the rolling years, bearing
her to the portals of dim old age, had
swept away.</p>

<p>She had studied magic, and tried to find
the elixir of life, but in vain. She had
discovered many wonderful things, but not
the fountain of perpetual youth, nor the
precious elixir of life.</p>

<p>For a few moments she stood gazing at
the fresh face and rich curls of the child,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
as he lay sleeping in his pure innocence.
Once the word &#8220;mother&#8221; passed his rosy
lips, and the woman waved a perfumed
fan over him, till even the mother was no
longer the companion of his dreamless
sleep.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, it will do to begin,&#8221; said the old
woman, and she took from a secret drawer
in the closet several bottles containing
liquids, and placed them on a little table.
Taking a pair of sharp scissors, she sat
down by the child, and cut off all his
beautiful brown curls, leaving only a little
tuft. This she made quite stiff in some
way, and colored it bright red, tying it
upon the top of his head, so that it stood
up and looked very strangely.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is the crimson tuft, my little
cup-bearer,&#8221; she said, laughing heartily at
her wicked work.</p>

<p>Then she tinged his eyebrows red, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
his skin a dark mahogany color, until, instead
of the beautiful little Paul that everybody
had loved and admired, he appeared
the ugliest little wretch one could well
imagine.</p>

<p>She took off his neat, plain clothes,
dressing him in yellow leather breeches
and a fantastic red jacket. Upon his feet
she put shoes with long pointed toes, that
turned up and were tied with red ribbons.
When she had finished, she looked at him
with great satisfaction.</p>

<p>&#8220;Even the old dame herself would not
know her cub now. What an ugly little
goat he has become, to be sure!&#8221; And the
old woman, after her usual way, muttered
to herself.</p>

<p>At last she sat down, and, eating and
drinking, for, by this time, she was quite
hungry, every few moments she would
stop and rub her long bony hands together,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
and laugh, as she looked at the
transformed child.</p>

<p>Paul slept all the afternoon, and awoke
in the dusky shadow of the twilight, confused
and bewildered, to find himself in a
strange room with the horrible woman,
sitting before a blazing fire, gazing steadily
into its fantastic pictures.</p>

<p>At first he could not tell where he was,
but in a moment he remembered all, and
jumped up in the greatest excitement, saying,
&#8220;How could I have slept, when the
dear mother was expecting me? She will
be so anxious. Oh, let me go to her!
Please, good lady, let me go!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean,&#8221; answered the old
woman. &#8220;You have no mother! you are
my little servant, Crimson Tuft. I gave
you that name, myself, on account of your
red hair, which stands up like a crest on
the top of your ugly head.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>Then the child began to cry, saying,
&#8220;My hair is not red, and my name is Paul,
and it was my dear mother who sold you
vegetables at the market this morning.
Let me go home, oh! please let me go home
to the dear mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>The child&#8217;s voice was broken with sobs,
but the hard-hearted woman only laughed,
&#8220;Ha! ha! it is a curious dream you have
had, or are you going crazy? your hair not
red! indeed! why, look in the glass yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>She led him to a mirror, and there the
unhappy child saw reflected the ugly
wretch called Crimson Tuft, but never
again the handsome little Paul.</p>

<p>The child was more frightened and bewildered
than ever. He was sure he had
left the mother that morning, in company
with this horrible old woman. Every
thing in the rude little home rose in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
mind, yet he could not realize his own
identity. Paul surely he could not see in
the reflecting mirror, only the ugly little
Crimson Tuft.</p>

<p>He raised his hands and took hold of
the stiff shock of red hair that stood up·
right upon his head. Oh, no! it was not
Paul&#8217;s soft silken curls.</p>

<p>Yet there <i>was a look</i> about the eyes
that reminded him of Paul, but even
they were very different: they were the
red, swollen, terror-strained eyes of Crimson
Tuft.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you satisfied now,&#8221; said the old woman.
&#8220;It was only a dream, a queer dream
that you have had, Crimson Tuft, and how
funny that you should think you were an
old vegetable-woman&#8217;s child. You, my
servant, who have never been out of this
place in your life.&#8221;</p>

<p>Still the child only cried the more, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
entreated, &#8220;Let me go home to the mother,
let me go home.&#8221;</p>

<p>Though he was faint from the effects of
the narcotic, and from fasting for a long
time, he refused food, and continued to sob,
begging the old woman to let him go home,
but she only answered, &#8220;you are dreaming
still, or crazy.&#8221; Then she told him how
sometimes people were bewitched, and did
not know themselves.</p>

<p>&#8220;Still, I am Paul, let me go.&#8221; At last
the woman, losing all patience, called the
dwarf to beat him, if he did not stop crying
and begin to eat. So terror and hunger
at last conquered, and the little boy,
choking down his sobs, sat upon a stool in
silence, to eat his supper, very desolate and
leaden hearted.</p>

<p>From that day a new era commenced
in the history of the child. An era of
servitude, sorrow, and tears, that washed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
away so far into the past the memory
of his free and joyous childhood, that
he began to believe what the woman
so often told him, that his mind had
gone astray, that he had been bewitched.</p>

<p>Sometimes he would stand looking long
into the great mirror, at the stiff, red hairs
and brown skin of poor Crimson Tuft,
thinking what a beautiful myth it was,
about the happy little Paul, and the dear
mother. How it had stolen into his heart
like a real life, and still the señora, as all
about the house called her, said it was
only a bewildering dream.</p>

<p>Into his eyes he would often look, saying,
&#8220;Those are Paul&#8217;s eyes, but the red
brows give a different expression to their
sadness,&#8221; he would add, &#8220;No! no! they
are not Paul&#8217;s eyes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Always the red hair, brown skin and sorrowful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
heart, &#8220;I must be only poor Crimson
Tuft.&#8221;</p>

<p>Very often his hungry heart would cry
out, &#8220;Oh, mother! mother!&#8221;</p>

<p>Too often the shrill voice of the old
woman would be the discordant answer,
sending him to some new task.</p>

<p>As months, then years, rolled by, the
child became more accustomed to his sorrowful
lot, and in many ways it grew pleasanter.
He learned to talk Spanish fluently,
and became very fond of the queer
looking dwarf, who had frightened him so
much at first. He often talked to him
about his mysterious change, but of these
things the dwarf would never speak, so at
last Crimson Tuft ceased to mention
them.</p>

<p>His kind-hearted friend taught him
many things in leisure hours&mdash;to read,
write, and solve difficult problems&mdash;so that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
at twelve, he was as much advanced in his
studies as most boys of his age.</p>

<p>With the señora he had become quite a
favorite, although at first, for a long time,
he had only menial service to perform,
there came a change. One day she heard
him reading aloud to the dwarf, and was
so much delighted with his distinct enunciation,
and fine rendition of what happened
to be a favorite author, that she
called him to her private library, and
talked a long time in a way she had never
before addressed him.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is a boy of quick mind,&#8221; thought she,
&#8220;and may be more than an ordinary servant
to me. He is just what I shall need in
my troublesome Mexican affairs. I must
train him to his work.&#8221;</p>

<p>From that day he used to sit hours in the
library reading to her, and often she gave
him long papers to copy, which he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
soon able to do, to her entire satisfaction.</p>

<p>Very often she would talk to him as
though he were a man, in fact the training
he was receiving brought only the man&#8217;s
thoughts. He had left his happy boyhood
at the little stall in the market-place.</p>

<p>One day he found an old guitar in the
attic of an out-house, which was filled with
broken furniture, and many things disused
and forgotten. From that hour he enjoyed
a real pleasure. In a short time he picked
out the chords and wove them into delicious
harmonies, and then there came into
his mind a rich old melody of the fatherland.
It was like the memory of a happy
dream, and the tears filled his eyes. Again
he was happy, for every thing save the
spell of the divine melody was forgotten.</p>

<p>Two more years glided by, and the
young boy was advancing toward manhood.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
He was tall, and finely developed;
and deep within his dreamy eyes slept the
wonderful magnetic charm. Still the
brown skin and stiff hair remained, and he
was only poor ugly Crimson Tuft.</p>

<p>In all this time he had never been outside
the massive gate which was always
strongly locked and barred; and though he
had often entreated the dwarf, the only
reply was a grave shake of the head, and
a sad, compassionate look, from the odd
squinting eyes of his companion, and if he
persisted the dwarf would go away and
leave him alone.</p>

<p>He had never ventured to speak to the
Señora but once, on the subject, in years,
and then her fury was so unbounded, that
he feared she would tear him in pieces with
her long bony fingers, which, when she was
enraged, possessed the power of a vice.
For a week after, she fed him on bread and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
water, and kept him confined in a dark
room with too heavy tasks to allow him
to question the mysterious past, or speculate
on the uncertain future.</p>

<p>&#8220;Always a foolish dreamer,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I
will teach you something, you, the brown-skinned
Crimson Tuft.&#8221;</p>

<p>Yet it was all no use: the boy had his
thoughts, that could not be chained. He
was determined to escape.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will not excite suspicion; I will strive
to please; and a time will come, yes, the
time will come, when I shall know all.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thus in striving to lull the suspicions of
the Argus-eyed woman to sleep, he grew
into great favor, and became indispensable
to her.</p>

<p>&#8220;He can do so many things that no one
else can do,&#8221; she would say to herself, &#8220;but
those great luminous eyes torment me. If
they too could be changed. But that is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
beyond my power. Would I could make
them dull leaden and red as his flaming
crimson tuft. He is useful, very useful,
but there are times, with all his quiet seeming,
when I think he suspects me. Dare I
trust him? that is the question.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here the old woman would fall into long
fits of musing, and gaze into the glowing
embers, till they faded into dead ashes.</p>

<p>One morning the old woman called Crimson
Tuft to her, saying: &#8220;I am going away,
to be gone for some days, and I want you to
copy these papers for me. They are the
deeds and other valuable papers of my
property in Mexico, which you will see is
very great. Let the copies be made with
great distinctness, for these duplicates may
be required. You see I am cautious, and
trust you very much, very much.&#8221;</p>

<p>A look of suspicion crossed her sharp
wizen face; but in the ugly brown countenance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
she could detect nothing but truth
and sincerity.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can do no better,&#8221; she thought, but
aloud she added, &#8220;the dwarf knows all and
will see to the safety of these and every
thing. If one of them is lost it would bring
no end of trouble, and you would have
your share.&#8221; With an ominous shake of the
head, the old señora rose and left Crimson
Tuft bending over the yellowed parchment,
that was of the most inestimable value to
her.</p>

<p>About noon she left the house, with the
dwarf following her to the gate, which,
when she had passed he barred more securely
than ever.</p>

<p>For some days Crimson Tuft worked diligently
over the papers. There were deeds
of haciendas and mines, mortgages, and
grants of land, and many long, intricate
pages of law papers. Really to copy all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
these was a task, and Crimson Tuft was
filled with amazement at the greatness of
the old señora&#8217;s possessions.</p>

<p>At last they were all finished, and locked
up by the dwarf in the iron-bound oaken
chest, and that again was locked in the
great closet, and the dwarf carried the key.
So it was very secure.</p>

<p>Still the old señora did not return!
&#8220;Now the time has come,&#8221; thought Crimson
Tuft, &#8220;I must escape.&#8221; But that was
easier planned than done. Everywhere the
dwarf followed him, and when Crimson
Tuft grew angry he laid his heavy hand
upon his arm, saying, &#8220;from the first I
have loved you, boy,&mdash;believe me it will all
be well&mdash;only wait a little longer.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Crimson Tuft took his hard, honest
hand, saying, &#8220;you alone have loved me,
and for your sake I will wait, but not long,
I <i>can not</i>&mdash;do not ask it.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>One evening, about a week after this, the
bell rang, and the señora entered, followed
by a most beautiful little maiden about
twelve years of age.</p>

<p>She was dressed in mourning, with a
black shawl about her head; her long
glossy hair hung carelessly over her graceful
shoulders; her complexion was a clear
olive, and her skin soft and smooth as satin;
while her large, dark eyes had a depth as
of the mystic sea, and a pure clear look as
of heaven.</p>

<p>They were more beautiful than any thing
Crimson Tuft had ever seen, and some how
they startled him. It was not like the old
vision, yet it touched him more deeply&mdash;this
was of the present&mdash;that of the past.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is my only granddaughter,&#8221; said
the old woman to the dwarf and Crimson
Tuft. Both bowed very low to the pretty
señorita. They were such a queer-looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
pair, that she clapped her dainty little
hands together laughing in a pure ringing
tone, clear as the notes of a silver
bell.</p>

<p>Poor Crimson Tuft was very much confused,
for to him the young Donna Leota
was the first dream of beauty that had
kindled the dawning fire of manhood in his
heart, and he was ready to bow down and
kiss her foot-prints in the sand.</p>

<p>Strange to say, the little Leota swayed
the grandmother as absolutely as she had
ruled the dwarf and Crimson Tuft, but in
one respect the old woman was resolute,
the heavy gate was locked as securely upon
Leota as upon the other inmates of the
mansion, and no persuasion could induce
her to change in this regard.</p>

<p>Leota was passionately fond of music,
and played the harp very sweetly.</p>

<p>Once in the still hours of night, she was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
awakened by the notes of her own harp
vibrating in the most exquisite harmony.</p>

<p>She was filled with delight though she
trembled with fear, for she was quite sure
there was no one in the house who knew
any thing of music but herself, yet the
chords were swept as by a master&#8217;s hand.</p>

<p>She lay motionless until the last note
died away, and it was long before she
fell asleep, for the spell of the rich melodies
still floated through the air around her.
In the morning she spoke of it, but no one
could explain the mystery. Again and
again, in the silent hours came the rich
melody, not old familiar airs, but the exquisite
improvisations of genius.</p>

<p>One night, when the golden moon was
casting its soft amber light over land and
sea, and the enchanted harp sending forth
its entrancing strains, Leota rose softly
from her couch, and summoning all her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
courage, determined herself to solve the
mystery. She glided quietly along the
passage-way to the large glass door of the
parlor, and there she saw Crimson Tuft
bending fondly over the harp, and calling
out the bewildering melody that she had
thought could be born only of mystical
enchantment. The imagination of the
young girl was so vivid that she was easily
prepared for things supernatural, but to
see poor brown Crimson Tuft, the great
magician, he, the slave, of whom she thought
only to laugh at&mdash;this was stranger than
all.</p>

<p>The soft moonlight fell full upon his
face, and his large luminous eyes were
dewy with the spirit of the rich melody.
With the rare beauty that was all their
own, they almost redeemed the brown skin
and flaming hair from positive ugliness.
Leota stood entranced till the last note<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
died out of the thrilled chords of the
trembling harp, then, as she turned to go,
the rustling of her robe caused Crimson
Tuft to raise his eyes, and they fell full
upon her face, to him at least the most
beautiful face in the world. He was
covered with deep confusion. Over his
redeeming eyes fell the heavy red lashes,
and the ugly brows contracted.</p>

<p>She, his rare divinity, had seen him play,
and heard how the notes flowed from his
own heart, through the sympathizing
harp-strings that thrilled with his devotion
to her, which would last all his life
long.</p>

<p>Leota was greatly bewildered, and as
she stole away to her own room, strange
thoughts chased themselves through her
mind. Not one word had been spoken,
but every thing had changed. Crimson
Tuft was no longer only the ugly servant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
of her grandmother, but he was Crimson
Tuft of the mystery.</p>

<p>There was something interesting in that;
besides, shut up in those high walls, with
only the old grandmother for company,
and little amusement, one must think a
great deal. So Leota had her thoughts.
Crimson Tuft had wonderful eyes. She
had found that out, and it was a great
deal there in that dull place.</p>

<p>She wished to be in Mexico again, where
the most beautiful flowers bloom, and the
delicious fruit grows ripe on the broad-leafed
trees. Yet she did not like to think
she would never see the beautiful eyes
again. &#8220;But one must not think too
much of a servant,&#8221; she would say to herself.
&#8220;She was of good blood, and that
would not do, yet one must treat inferiors
kindly.&#8221; Really it was difficult to tell
what one must do. So, all in a maze, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
fell asleep, and dreamed of the most radiant
eyes, which <i>were</i> Crimson Tuft&#8217;s, and the
handsomest face, which surely <i>was not</i>
Crimson Tuft&#8217;s.</p>

<p>The morning dawned clear and bright,
as Crimson Tuft arose and began the duties
of the day. Though he was advanced
to the post of private secretary,
the old señora had left him some tasks in
the early part of the day that would prevent
him from forgetting his position as a
servant.</p>

<p>First he swept and dusted the parlor
and halls. This had always been his work,
and no one else could please the señora so
well. As he dusted the señorita&#8217;s harp a
flash of indignation filled his heart. He
was only a servant, the ugly Crimson Tuft,
and she the most beautiful maiden, the
divinity of his soul. There was a great
difference, yet he felt himself a man, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
he would conquer fate in the end, even
with his ugly Crimson Tuft. This was
what he thought.</p>

<p>When Leota appeared she said nothing
of her discovery, but when she spoke to
him it was in a different tone from formerly.
The mystery of the enchanted harp
was over, but the greater mystery had
begun.</p>

<p>The wonderful eyes acted as a talisman
upon her heart, and though she strove
against it, she found herself forgetting
Crimson Tuft&#8217;s position, his ugly brown
skin and red hair.</p>

<p>One glance of his beaming eyes would
set her warm blood dancing through her
veins till her neck and brow were a soft
rose-tint, and this was in no way pleasant
to the proud little maiden.</p>

<p>The next night Crimson Tuft did not
touch the harp, and in the morning the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
Donna Leota passed him at his work with a
haughty toss of her dainty head, but with a
quiver in her voice she said, &#8220;Crimson Tuft,
play when you like, the music pleases me.&#8221;</p>

<p>After that Crimson Tuft would always
play at twilight, and even the old grandmother
was touched by the magical spell of
his genius.</p>

<p>Every year the old woman grew more
infirm, till she could not even walk from
room to room without leaning upon her
staff. At times her temper was terrible,
and nothing but the soft touch of Leota&#8217;s
hand could calm her. She loved with all
her strong hard nature the young maiden
who daily was growing to womanhood
crowned with surpassing beauty.</p>

<p>She was getting very old. With an
iron will she resisted the pitiless hand of
time, but she could not stay it. Her long
hands became more bony and angular, her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
eyes more red and bleared, and her voice
more cracked and shrill; yet she seemed to
be looking forward to a long life, and was
more hard and grasping than ever. It was
only Leota that she loved more than gold.</p>

<p>One night Crimson Tuft had a curious
dream. He thought, as he lay half sleeping
and half waking, dreaming delightful
but impossible things, that the old woman
came in softly and poured something upon
his head, and that when he started, she
held a sponge to his nose, until he sank
back powerless. He seemed to inhale
something sweet and fragrant. It was
very pleasant and soothing: that was all
he could remember. In the morning, he
felt heavy and drowsy, his head ached, but
he roused himself, rose and dressed as
usual. When he looked in the glass he
saw that his hair was redder, and his skin
a deeper brown than ever. Memories<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
and a strange suspicion flashed over his
mind.</p>

<p>Far back in the years he remembered
dimly a little boy, named Paul, a fair child,
whom he had been taught to believe a
dream. There was a mystery. Could she
have changed Paul to Crimson Tuft in a
night?</p>

<p>After this, Crimson Tuft became more
thoughtful than ever. There was a mystery
to solve, and he would devote all his
energies to it. He was eighteen years old,
a very intelligent young man, but entirely
unacquainted with the world. He had yet
much to learn.</p>

<p>One day the old woman called him to
her, and looked, in her curious way, at
him for a long time. &#8220;Crimson Tuft,&#8221; she
said, &#8220;you are my servant, but I have
given you great advantages, so that you
are as well educated as many a rich man&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
son. But that is not all; I wish to make
your fortune.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the old woman fell into a deep
study, and Crimson Tuft stood waiting
and wondering what would come next.</p>

<p>At length he grew tired. &#8220;Señora,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;you wanted to speak with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>She gave a sudden start as he spoke.
&#8220;Oh! yes,&#8221; she replied, &#8220;but I had forgotten
you. You are my servant, and have
been so always.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Always?&#8221; asked Crimson Tuft.</p>

<p>A dark frown passed over the old woman&#8217;s
face, and Crimson Tuft regretted his
folly. He was very anxious to hear what
she had to say to him. There might be
some hope of relief. But again she was
silent; and, worse than all, she seemed
displeased.</p>

<p>The Donna Leota passed the open window,
singing lightly a pretty Spanish air,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
and the shadows began to clear away from
the clouded brow.</p>

<p>&#8220;Excuse me, señora,&#8221; said Crimson Tuft,
softly. &#8220;If in some way I can serve you, I
shall be only too happy.&#8221; He, too, had
heard the soothing song.</p>

<p>&#8220;Crimson Tuft,&#8221; she replied, &#8220;I am not
now so strong as I was twenty good years
ago, and I want some one near me whom
I can trust, for I have affairs that must be
attended to now&mdash;some one who will not
cheat me out of my gold. I have looked
carefully about, and can see no one but
you&mdash;you, whom I have trained, educated,
and cared for so many years. The world is
so ungrateful and wicked! Even you, who
owe every thing to me, might rob me&mdash;me,
an old woman. It would be a wicked
thing&mdash;a great crime!&#8221;</p>

<p>The red, eager eyes of the old woman
were fastened upon the face of the young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
man, and with all her shrewdness she tried
to read him. Her pinched features grew
sharper, and her voice shrill as the whistling
wind. She grasped her staff, and
hobbled across the room several times, in
an excited manner.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are such a curious, ugly fellow.
What have <i>you</i> to hope for in the world,
save from me? But, if you are faithful, I
will advance you. But I can as easily
punish as reward.&#8221;</p>

<p>The red blood flushed even the brown
cheek of the boy, for he was painfully
conscious of his extreme ugliness, and he
thought sadly of the Donna Leota.</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen, boy,&#8221; continued the old woman.
&#8220;There is a great world beyond these
walls. Can I trust you to go away over
the waters with me? Remember all I
promise you, and be faithful.&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked steadfastly into the luminous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
eyes of Crimson Tuft, that dilated with
pleasurable exultation. She was evidently
satisfied with the truth and sincerity she
saw beaming there, for she proceeded:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I must go again to Mexico, but not
alone. The Donna Leota will accompany
me, for in the years to come I can not be
separated from her. And you must go, as
I shall need you. I am very rich, and
must trust you with a great secret; but I
have studied you well.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Señora,&#8221; said Crimson Tuft, eagerly,
&#8220;I will be true to you; you shall never
regret.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Swear it!&#8221; she said, fiercely.</p>

<p>So the young boy knelt, and pressed the
good book to his lips, repeating after her
a most solemn oath, to serve her faithfully,
and keep sacred the great secret, which was
to be revealed to Leota only, in case of the
grandmother&#8217;s death.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>&#8220;Now,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I am weary. To-morrow
I will tell you all.&#8221; And she
leaned back in the arm-chair, and shaded
her eyes with her fan. Crimson Tuft went
out, with his heart beating wild in a tumult
of conflicting emotions.</p>

<p>On the morrow, again she called him to
the library, and locked the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have made my will,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and
you are handsomely provided for, in consideration
of your proving faithful to the
trust I repose in you. Besides this, while I
live, you shall never want for gold. Is it
all fully understood?&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Crimson Tuft said, &#8220;It is understood,
señora, fully.&#8221; And she took from
her desk a carefully sealed paper, which
she wrapped in sheep-skin, and, again sealing
it, gave it to the boy. &#8220;This paper,&#8221;
she said, &#8220;describes the exact spot where a
great treasure is hidden upon my hacienda,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
near the City of Mexico. There is no
chance of your gaining this for yourself
for there are two other persons living who
have similar papers; indeed, precautions,
that I shall not tell you of, have been
taken, so that it must fall to the Donna
Leota at last, for she is the only true
heiress. You see I am cautious, very cautious,&#8221;
she added, the old look of suspicion
rising in her face.</p>

<p>From this day Crimson Tuft was her
chief adviser. He and the dwarf made
all preparations for the journey. In about
a week all was ready, and they went to
San Francisco in a carriage, which drove
immediately down to the steamer, and they
were soon comfortably settled on board.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said Crimson Tuft, &#8220;there is
still time, and I can walk about the city
for half an hour.&#8221; But the señora grew
excited, and exclaimed, &#8220;No! no! you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
might get lost; remember, you are a
stranger.&#8221; And the Donna Leota said,
softly, &#8220;Surely, you will not go away!&#8221;</p>

<p>So the dwarf performed all the commissions,
and for an hour the señora was absent;
but, before leaving, she had said to
Crimson Tuft, &#8220;I leave the Donna Leota in
your care.&#8221;</p>

<p>At length the ship sailed. Then came
the long, sluggish, dreamy days at sea.
Crimson Tuft and Leota were often together
upon the deck, for the old señora
would not allow her there alone. What golden
days they were to the poor Crimson Tuft.
More and more he was growing to love the
pretty young señorita, and she could not resist
the powerful spell of his luminous eyes.</p>

<p>One night she rushed wildly through
the saloon to his state-room. The grandmother
had been taken suddenly very ill,
and must see Crimson Tuft.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>She breathed with great difficulty, and
her words came low and broken: &#8220;If I
live to reach Mexico, you will not need
this paper; but I am old,&#8221; she added, bitterly,
&#8220;and the old must die.&#8221;</p>

<p>With great pain she went on: &#8220;If I
should not live to reach the hacienda, you
will see the child has her own. Dig up
the treasure yourself, and do not defraud
her of one single gold piece, or the curse of
a dying woman will follow you, even from
the darkness of the grave.&#8221; Then again
Crimson Tuft promised, and, taking the
paper, left her alone with &#8220;the child,&#8221; as
she still fondly called the Donna Leota.</p>

<p>This attack passed away, but another
soon followed, and again Crimson Tuft was
summoned to her side. Her glazed eye
brightened as she saw him. &#8220;Remember,&#8221;
was all she could say, and again he made
the solemn promise. It was the third and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
last time. With the old señora all was
now over.</p>

<p>Leota trembled with fear, and wept bitterly.
The grandmother had loved her, and
now there was no one left, only Crimson
Tuft, who sat by her side all through the
silent hours.</p>

<p>The next evening, at sunset, the old
señora was buried in the sea.</p>

<p>No one wept but the beautiful young
maiden, as the steamer went on, leaving in
its wake the cold, lifeless body, wrapped in
its shroud of sparkling waters.</p>

<p>At length the good ship arrived safely
in Mexico, and Crimson Tuft took the proud
young heiress to the hacienda, where a
crowd of friends and retainers awaited her.</p>

<p>The will was opened, and there was a
large legacy left to Crimson Tuft. But it was
as nothing to him. With so much ugliness,
what had he to hope for!</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>In the last paper the señora had handed
him, there was a still fuller description of
the spot where the treasure was hidden,
and a night appointed for him to seek it.
It was the eighteenth birthnight of the
Donna Leota. Till then, she was to be placed
in a convent, and Crimson Tuft was to have
the best tutors in the City of Mexico. This
would make a man of him.</p>

<p>So the young people were separated for
a time, but the two years soon rolled by,
and Crimson Tuft returned to the hacienda
with his papers.</p>

<p>What a change there was in him. His
brown, dark face had grown every day more
fair, and his stiff red hair more soft and
silky, and of a rich brown color. It was
really wonderful. The young man was
transformed, day by day, from the ugly
Crimson Tuft to the handsome Paul.</p>

<p>The Donna Leota had become the beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
woman that her childhood promised,
and when she met Paul after the two years
of separation, she felt that the great mystery
was solved, and knew that she could
never love any one else. So they were betrothed,
and she was to be made his wife on
her eighteenth birthday.</p>

<p>At the appointed time, Paul sought and
found the great treasure that had been hidden
for so long. There were immense iron
pots, full of shining gold pieces, that had
been hidden during one of the many Mexican
revolutions. Thus it was found that the
Donna Leota was the richest maiden in all
Mexico, and she had many suitors among the
wealthy Spanish hidalgoes; but she cared
only for Paul, for the spell of the wonderful
eyes, which had been Crimson Tuft&#8217;s, was
upon her.</p>

<p>At last, the joyous wedding-day came,
and every one said, &#8220;What a tall, handsome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
señor is the bridegroom, and how very
lovely the bride. The sun shines upon them
and it will be a happy marriage.&#8221;</p>

<p>Soon after, they went to San Francisco,
and Paul felt the old dream returning.</p>

<p>One day, as he walked through the market-place,
he came to a vegetable stand.
Behind it sat a sorrowful woman, with a
sad, mild face, that woke the sleeping memories
of his heart. &#8220;Mother!&#8221; he exclaimed,
with a thrill of tenderness in his voice that
raised the bowed head of the lonely one.
She gave one look into the eyes that, once
seen, could never be forgotten, and cried,
&#8220;Paul! my son, my son!&#8221; and opening her
arms, received upon her bosom the head of
her long lost treasure.</p>

<p>How she wept, and smiled, and pressed
him to her heart; then held him off, that she
might gaze upon the dear handsome face.</p>

<p>Then they went home to the father, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
was old and sick. He had lost strength
and heart years ago, and they were very
poor. &#8220;He has never held up his head,&#8221;
so the mother said, &#8220;since our boy was
taken from us.&#8221;</p>

<p>But that was all over; the lost was
found; poverty, sorrow, and sickness fled
with his presence.</p>

<p>He took the old father and mother home
to Leota, who received them into her own
heart; for, were they not his parents and
hers?</p>

<p>At first the old vegetable woman stood
a little in awe of her high-born daughter,
but that soon melted away in the warmth of
the dainty little Señora&#8217;s affection; and the
father, mother, son, and daughter, lived all
their lives together, a happy family, united
in heart and mind by the silken bonds of
a true, earnest affection.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">SNOWDROP AND ROSEBUD.<br />

<small>A CALIFORNIA STORY.</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Years</span> ago, before the gold-seekers came
to California, there lived at the Mission of
San Gabriel, a Spaniard, whose beautiful
vineyard was admired by all the country.</p>

<p>In early life he had been a great traveler,
and while in Germany, he met a fair golden-haired
maiden, whom he loved and married.
After a few years he emigrated to
America, and settled at the Mission of San
Gabriel&mdash;near the town of Los Angeles.</p>

<p>There he prospered greatly, his cattle
increased to great herds, covering the green
hill-sides, and his vineyard was the pride
of his heart. He built a pleasant house,
and surrounded it with a garden filled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
with all kinds of fruit. In that delicious
climate, fruits of the tropic and temperate
zones grow together; while the white
flowers of the North, and their crimson-hued
sisters of the South, blossom side by side.</p>

<p>There seemed nothing wanting to make
his happiness complete but children. The
house was too silent; he wished for the
silvery laughter of childish voices; he
longed to press little ones to his heart, and
call them his own.</p>

<p>At last, God gave him two little girls;
but the fair, golden-haired mother lived
only to bless them, and was then buried by
the clear &#8220;Lake of the Tulés.&#8221; At first he
was inconsolable, and for months refused
to see his little ones; but one day, while he
slept, the old Indian nurse took them into
his room, and laid them on the bed by his
side.</p>

<p>Little Snowdrop nestled in his bosom,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
but Rosebud ran her fingers into his beard,
and pulled it so hard that she woke him.
There she was, when he opened his eyes,
crowing with delight&mdash;her little rosy lips
close to his, and the fair Snowdrop in his
bosom.</p>

<p>Then all the father&#8217;s love, which had
only slept, awoke, and he pressed the little
ones to his heart, weeping; but especially
he loved the beautiful Snowdrop, she was
so like her mother.</p>

<p>After this, although he still mourned
greatly for his wife, he loved these little
ones very dearly; and as years passed by,
became happy in the absorbing devotion
to them, which filled his whole heart.</p>

<p>He watched over them with the most
jealous care. Even in childhood, he would
not allow them to play with other children;
and as they grew older, his fear
was awakened lest some of the young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
señors of Los Angeles should see and fall
in love with them. For his daughters to
form a mèsalliance, he was quite sure would
break his heart.</p>

<p>As he was obliged often to go from
home on business, he employed an old
Indian woman as duenna, and charged her
never to allow the girls out of her sight
for a moment.</p>

<p>Rosebud was a Spanish girl, with purple-tinged
hair, soft black eyes, and clear
olive complexion. Through the satin skin
the warm blood flushed her cheeks, and her
lips were more tempting than ripe cherries;
but Snowdrop was a rare German
maiden in complexion, clear and fair as
the noonday. Her eyes were like violets.
Her hair in the sunshine was like fine
spun gold, and so long that it reached to
her feet, and hung like a mantle of glory
about her.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>It was no wonder the old man guarded
his daughters so carefully; for though so
different, they were equally beautiful, and
all the young men of good family were
anxious to pay court to them.</p>

<p>Day by day they sat upon the piazza of
the inner court, reading the fascinating
romances of old Spain, which was to them
the dreamland of delight. They longed
very much to go out, and see something of
life among the rich Spanish families about
San Gabriel and Los Angeles, but their
father would not allow it; and the old
duenna was always near them; even when
they walked through the vineyard or the
orange orchard, she followed them.</p>

<p>One day, Rosebud called Snowdrop into
the garden, and sitting under a large almond-tree,
she said: &#8220;Look over this book
of prints with me, while we talk softly,
for the duenna must not hear every thing.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>Snowdrop rested her golden tresses
upon her sister&#8217;s arm, and, turning over the
leaves of the book, they talked together.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sister dear,&#8221; said Rosebud, &#8220;we lead a
very dull life here. All young girls are
gay and happy. What is the use of being
beautiful, with no one to see us but servants
and old women?&#8221; A look of conscious
beauty gathered around her pouting
lips, as she ran her dainty fingers through
the silken meshes of her sister&#8217;s golden
hair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our dear papa loves us,&#8221; said Snowdrop,
&#8220;but I do wish to be loved by others,&#8221;
she added&mdash;her violet eyes softening, and
a faint flush spreading over her fair cheeks
and neck.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I to be admired! but how can we
be either?&#8221; replied Rosebud, &#8220;shut up here,
with the old duenna to watch every thing
we do? God made us beautiful, and I&#8217;m<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
sure he intended us to be seen. And for
my part, I am determined to go to the
consul&#8217;s grand ball, if I have to run away!&#8221;
and her pretty dark eyes filled with
tears.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! sister Rosebud, think of the dear
papa!&#8221; said Snowdrop.</p>

<p>&#8220;He did not tell us not to go out of the
garden alone; he only told the duenna to
watch us. If we could only manage her,&#8221;
said Rosebud, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am afraid it would not be right,&#8221;
replied Snowdrop, &#8220;but I want to go very
much. We will make an altar-cloth, and
embroider it with gold, as an offering to
the Blessed Virgin. Perhaps she will
pity our loneliness, and help us.&#8221;</p>

<p>So they wrought an altar-cloth of purple
and gold, and spread it upon the
altar, before the picture of the Blessed
Mother, in their own chamber; putting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
vases of beautiful flowers upon it. When
it was finished they were quite happy, and
sat down with their guitars, and sang very
sweetly together, till their father came
home.</p>

<p>The next morning, an old Mexican woman,
with baskets of trinkets for sale, knocked
at the garden gate.</p>

<p>When she was admitted, she spread out
her finery before the young señoritas. The
duenna hastened to the piazza where they
were sitting&mdash;for no one was more fond of
looking over the <i>vendedora&#8217;s</i> basket than
she, always finding something she could
not do without among its tempting stores&mdash;this
time it was a gay-colored shawl, and
she ran away for her purse.</p>

<p>As soon as she was out of sight, the old
woman whispered:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pretty señoritas, I have charms to sell.
This will make you admired, and this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
loved,&#8221; she said, holding up two curious
little bags&mdash;one tied with long pink ribbon,
the other with blue&mdash;&#8220;and this,&#8221;
pointing to a third, &#8220;will make you sleep.
It contains a powder. You must drop one
grain into a glass of water. It is perfectly
tasteless, but it brings on a sleep so profound,
that until the effect passes away,
nothing could awaken you from pleasant
dreams.&#8221;</p>

<p>The young girls bought the charms.
Snowdrop took the one tied with blue ribbon,
and placing it in her bosom, whispered,
&#8220;Now I may be loved.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I will be admired,&#8221; said Rosebud,
taking the other; but the charm for sleep
she concealed in her pocket, just as the
old duenna returned, eager for her purchases.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have pretty slippers for little dancing
feet,&#8221; said the old woman, holding up two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
pairs of the daintiest white satin slippers
you could imagine.</p>

<p>&#8220;The señoritas have no use for them,&#8221;
exclaimed the duenna, frowning; but the
young girls found that they fitted so nicely,
and looked so pretty, they bought them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Papa is rich enough to give us any
thing we want, and we fancy these,&#8221; said
Rosebud. They bought strings of beads,
ribbons, and combs for their hair, until the
old duenna was nearly frantic. What
they could want of all these, shut up as
they were, she could not tell.</p>

<p>Then Rosebud said:&mdash;&#8220;We will have
some new dresses;&#8221; so they bought fine
white muslin and lace. Snowdrop bought
a bright-colored handkerchief, which she
gave the duenna, who was so much pleased
that she promised to help them make their
dresses.</p>

<p>As soon as the old woman went away,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
they all sat upon the piazza, shaded with
vines, and commenced cutting and stitching
upon the delicate fabric so busily, that
by evening the skirts of their dresses were
quite finished.</p>

<p>The next morning they were early at
work again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do you hurry so much,&#8221; said the
duenna, who never liked to work very
long at a time.</p>

<p>&#8220;To have it over the sooner, dear duenna,&#8221;
answered Snowdrop, smiling so
sweetly that the duenna took her needle
again quite pleasantly.</p>

<p>Snowdrop&#8217;s dress was trimmed with blue
ribbon, Rosebud&#8217;s with crimson and gold.
The young girls wrought upon them all
their pretty fancies, till, when they were
finished, the duenna thought them beautiful
enough for a queen.</p>

<p>At evening the work was all done; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
the duenna, quite fatigued with her unaccustomed
task, sat dozing in her arm-chair.</p>

<p>Suddenly she roused herself, exclaiming:&mdash;&#8220;How
warm it is! I am very
thirsty.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rosebud jumped up quickly, saying,
&#8220;I will bring you fresh water;&#8221; so she ran
down to the spring at the foot of the
garden, and there she met the faithful old
Miguel&mdash;who had been in the family for
years before she was born, and loved the
young señoritas as though they were his
own children.</p>

<p>Rosebud caught him by the arm, and
whispered:&mdash;&#8220;Have the horses at the back
garden-gate to-night at nine o&#8217;clock, you
dear old Miguel, for you shall take us to
the consul&#8217;s ball.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But the señor?&#8221; said the old servant,
in astonishment.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>&#8220;Never mind the señor, you dear, careful
man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But the duenna?&#8221; he continued.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind! never mind! I tell you
I will go! so be sure you are ready in
time,&#8221; said Rosebud, laughing, and shaking
her finger as she ran away.</p>

<p>Poor old Miguel was in a great dilemma.
He loved the pretty señoritas, and wanted
to help them; but he feared the señor.</p>

<p>&#8220;It may cost me my place; and in this
family I have lived, and here I would die;
but my pretty children are so lonely, it is
too bad to shut them up&mdash;and old Miguel
will not fail them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thus his fond love for the fair girls he
had carried in his arms in their helpless
infancy, conquered his discretion; and he
went to the stable to groom the horses.</p>

<p>Rosebud brought the water&mdash;clear, cool,
and sparkling&mdash;to the old duenna, and she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
drank it eagerly in her thirst, little dreaming
of the sleep-charm the gay young señorita
had dropped into the cup.</p>

<p>Almost instantly she became very drowsy,
and, closing her eyes, she fell asleep in
her chair. In a short time her heavy
breathing told how surely the charm had
taken effect.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now for the ball!&#8221; said Rosebud. So
the young girls dressed themselves quickly,
but with great care&mdash;looping their sleeves
with rare flowers from the garden, and
tying their ribbons very tastefully.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think we shall do,&#8221; said Rosebud,
looking at the beautiful girl reflected from
her mirror, then at the softer beauty of her
sister.</p>

<p>Snowdrop answered by a kiss, and they
went out softly, and down the garden path
to the gate, where the faithful Miguel waited
for them.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>An hour&#8217;s ride brought them to the
brilliantly lighted mansion of the consul,
and all the young señors were delighted
at the arrival of the fair sisters.</p>

<p>No one was so much courted and admired,
among all the fair señoritas at the
ball that night, as Snowdrop and Rosebud;
and none of the gay hidalgoes were more
happy than old Miguel, who was peeping
from behind the hall door, enjoying the
triumph of his darlings. At last he became
uneasy, and, approaching them with
a respectful bow, told them it was time to
go home.</p>

<p>Taking special leave of their host and
hostess, bowing gracefully to the guests,
they started for home&mdash;leaving all, admirers,
and many lovers behind them.</p>

<p>When they entered their chamber, they
found the duenna still sleeping soundly.
They undressed themselves noiselessly, putting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
away all their clothes but their slippers,
which they forgot.</p>

<p>In the morning, when the sun arose, the
duenna awoke, and was much surprised to
find herself sitting in a chair, instead of
being in bed.</p>

<p>She had but a confused recollection of
things, and began to think she must have
taken a little more wine than she intended
at dinner the day before. She thought she
remembered Rosebud giving her a glass
of water when she was very thirsty, but
she was not sure that it might not have
been wine.</p>

<p>She looked around, but could discover
nothing to help her. The two girls were
sleeping soundly, and upon the face of
Rosebud there was a smile. She was
dreaming of the ball&mdash;again surrounded
by a crowd of admirers.</p>

<p>Snowdrop dreamed of the dear papa;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
he was angry with them for their disobedience,
and her long eyelashes were wet
with tears.</p>

<p>&#8220;How different they are in their ways,
even in sleep!&#8221; said the duenna.</p>

<p>She turned away, and as her eye fell
upon the forgotten slippers, her searching
glance detected that they had been
worn.</p>

<p>&#8220;What does this mean? So much worn,
and bought yesterday! &#8217;Tis very strange!&#8221;
mused she, and put them in her pocket.</p>

<p>She woke the young girls, but they fell
asleep again. They were so unused to
dancing late at night, that they were very
tired; and when the bell rang for breakfast,
they did not appear.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are my dear daughters?&#8221; said
the father, with a clouded face.</p>

<p>She could only tell him that they were
still asleep, and seemed very tired.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>&#8220;So are my horses,&#8221; replied he, angrily;
&#8220;but I will see about this.&#8221;</p>

<p>The duenna was afraid to show him the
shoes, lest he should blame her; but in
her confusion, as she drew her handkerchief
from her pocket, one of them dropped
out upon the floor.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is this?&#8221; said the señor, sternly;
and she was obliged to tell him all she
knew.</p>

<p>For some time the troubled father walked
the floor with great agitation without
speaking, while the duenna stood trembling
before him. Then, turning to her quickly,
he said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Call my daughters;&#8221; and he rang the
bell for Miguel.</p>

<p>All three came into the room with fearful
hearts; but Snowdrop&#8217;s face was covered
with her golden hair, and the tears
were shining through it.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>Turning to Miguel, he said, sternly,
with a black frown covering his whole
face:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Stand here, and tell me how it is, that
this morning I find my horses reeking with
foam?&#8221;</p>

<p>The old man only answered, &#8220;I alone am
to blame, señor. Pardon your old servant,
who loves you and yours!&#8221; and he clasped
his hands, and looked imploringly at the
dark, angry face that frowned upon him.</p>

<p>Then Snowdrop could bear it no longer,
so she ran to the father&mdash;throwing her
white arms around his neck, and resting
her golden-crowned head upon his bosom,
she said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear papa, I will tell you all! Only
do not blame dear, good old Miguel.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then she told him of all their loneliness,
and eager longings for companions of their
own age; about the altar-cloth and all,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
without reserving one thing. &#8220;And now
we are sorry; it was wrong; but the dear
papa will forgive!&#8221; and she raised her
pretty face, all shining with tears, and
begged him to kiss her.</p>

<p>How like her mother she was! and the
father thought of the sunny days of his
youth, when he had wandered on the
banks of the Rhine with the fair German
maiden, and wondered how he could forget
that the young and ardent hearts of his
children must be like the heart of his
youth.</p>

<p>He kissed the innocent face upturned to
his, and forgave them, saying, &#8220;I, too, have
been to blame; and, in future, I will go
with you to all places, my darlings, where
it is proper, and right for you to go.&#8221;</p>

<p>Snowdrop and Rosebud were delighted,
and willingly promised never again to deceive
&#8220;the dear papa;&#8221; and from that day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
there was mutual confidence and love between
the young girls and the father.</p>

<p>After a time, when two brave and gallant
knights sought of the father the hands
of the fair señoritas in marriage, he answered,
&#8220;Let the hearts of my dear children
decide for you. My only wish is to
see them happy.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a great feast made at their
marriage; and the old Spanish house, so
long wrapped in seclusion, resounded with
joyous music and the merry laughter of
light hearts. Again old Miguel stood behind
the door, and rejoiced to see his darlings
loved, admired, and happy.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">LAZARUS AND BUMMER.</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was a dark rainy day in the land
where the rain makes the winter, and the
sunshine and blue sky the pleasant summer-time.</p>

<p>Through the Golden Gate, came the ship
to the new city of hope, and all the people
on board thought, &#8220;how happy and rich we
shall become in the Gold Land. Though the
city is now only a miserable place of tents
and sand hills, one day how great it will
be, and we shall live to see it. The fair
Golden City.&#8221;</p>

<p>On the rude wharf stood the expectant
crowd. To them the ship was the beautiful
carrier-dove, with its white wings
spread to bring them news of home.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>&#8220;Perhaps there will be some one from
the old home,&#8221; said a young man, with his
brown eyes filled with eager longing. &#8220;The
dark old Atlantic! how its breakers used
to dash upon the rocks in sight of home.
It was glorious. To-morrow will be Christmas!
I wonder, will they remember all, as
I do!&#8221;</p>

<p>By his side stood a great shaggy dog, who
belonged to nobody.</p>

<p>He talked only in the dog language, but
was very learned, and understood all the
young man said. He was a wonderful dog,
and had his thoughts. &#8220;I am my own
master,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and that is pleasant&mdash;yet
one likes to be cared for, and nobody cares
for me. I shall get no news from home,
and to-morrow will be Christmas. This is
not as it should be; I must see to it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The great dog was getting quite out of
temper, and, with a surly growl, he turned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
round so quickly, that he gave the young
man a start.</p>

<p>&#8220;One would think the dog was mad,&#8221;
said he, &#8220;only it is not the season.&#8221; Then
he looked out again hopefully to the coming
ship.</p>

<p>The great dog ran round the corner, and
through the wet streets all day.</p>

<p>The steamer had arrived, and there were
new faces looking eagerly about for old familiar
ones, and the old were looking for the
new; so there was altogether a great bustle
such as was never seen, only in those early
days when the ships came in from home.
Thus the day passed, and the evening came
on, raining dismally&mdash;yet it was Christmas
eve.</p>

<p>In a dark alley sat the great dog. His
shaggy coat kept him warm, yet it was very
desolate there alone.</p>

<p>&#8220;One should have something to live for,&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
growled he, &#8220;something to take care of and
protect, or there is no use in being strong
and brave. One might as well be a puny
poodle, and sit by the parlor fire,&#8221; and he
gave an ugly bark, &#8220;bow, wow, wow! one
should have an object in life.&#8221;</p>

<p>Just then he heard a low moan, and looking
round, he saw a poor lame dog, very
thin and sick, lying down in the mud, and
ready to die of hunger.</p>

<p>It was really quite wretched, and all the
great dog&#8217;s sympathies were aroused.
&#8220;There <i>is</i> an object, to be sure,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It
is Christmas eve, and the good Santa Claus
has taken pity on me, and given me this
poor fellow, who needs me as much as I do
him. What a zest life has, when one has
something to live for.&#8221;</p>

<p>Without any useless ceremony, he raised
the poor dog, and tenderly as the mother
dog carries her little ones, he bore him to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
a warm, dry place, and made him a nice bed
of clean straw.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is better, my friend,&#8221; said the noble
creature, quite flushed and happy
with the pleasure of doing a kind act.
&#8220;What more can I do for you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am famishing with hunger,&#8221; replied
the lame dog, with a feeble groan, and off
went his great shaggy protector, through
rain and mud, to a restaurant, and there
the cook gave him a bone, saying, &#8220;take it,
you Bummer.&#8221;</p>

<p>He caught the bone, and running off as
fast as possible, in a few moments laid it
before the lame dog.</p>

<p>It was a rich bone, and had a delicious
smell that was quite reviving to the sick
one.</p>

<p>It was so pleasant to see the poor hungry
fellow eat, that Bummer could not leave
him until he had finished. &#8220;I never enjoyed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
a bone so much in my life,&#8221; said Bummer,
as he tucked the warm straw around his
new friend, and saw him closing his eyes
with a pleasant satisfied languor.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is something like living,&#8221; added he,
with a lively bark, as he ran back to the
restaurant for his own dinner.</p>

<p>&#8220;Coming again, Bummer?&#8221; said the
jolly, red-faced cook, throwing him another
bone, which he ate with a famous relish.</p>

<p>In the morning he went back again to
the restaurant, serving the sick dog first,
and again at night, and day after day, till
he became the jolly cook&#8217;s regular pensioner.</p>

<p>At the restaurant they grew quite curious
to know what became of the first bone,
and sent some one to follow Bummer, who
came back telling the strange story, and saying,
&#8220;it is really quite wonderful.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then every one talked of it, and soon
the whole town came to know the two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
dogs, and called them Bummer and Lazarus.</p>

<p>In the pleasant days they walked out
together, Bummer always watching over
Lazarus with the tenderest care. It was
really a pleasant sight to see them, they
were so happy together.</p>

<p>Thus time passed away, making no
change in the protecting devotion of Bummer,
nor the trusting love of Lazarus.</p>

<p>But there must be an end of all things,
and at last Lazarus died.</p>

<p>This was a great sorrow to poor Bummer,
and he grew so thin and wretched that the
jolly cook was quite distressed.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must cheer up, my good Bummer;
really it will never do; you <i>must</i> cheer up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is all over now,&#8221; said the dog, &#8220;one
must have something to live for. It is no
use, one must have an object.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was no longer the Bummer of old, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
he went away to the place where Lazarus
rested.</p>

<p>&#8220;He forgot to eat his bone,&#8221; said the jolly
cook; &#8220;poor fellow, we were getting used
to him, and we shall miss him. He belonged
to the town&mdash;he was &#8216;our dog.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>This was the last time he went for his
bone. It was all over, and Bummer and
Lazarus became a remembrance which has
passed into a tradition.</p>

<p>The skin of Bummer was carefully stuffed,
and placed in a glass case. It may still be
seen in some restaurant on Montgomery
Street, where it is preserved as a precious
relic of the olden time.</p>

<p>This is a true story, little ones, and no
doubt the fathers will tell you, how, in the
olden days, he has often seen Bummer and
Lazarus.</p>

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
